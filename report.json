It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

        "contributing": "We're really happy to accept contributions to the mdn-browser-compat-data repository!\nThis file lists some general guidelines to help you contributing effectively.\n\n## Types of contribution\n\nThere are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:\n\n* **Adding new compat data**: familiarize yourself with the [schema](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data.schema.json) and read the [schema docs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data-schema.md) to add new files.\n* **Fixing existing compat data**: maybe a browser now supports a certain feature. Yay! If you open a PR to fix a browser's data, it would be most helpful if you include a link to a bug report or similar so that we can double-check the good news.\n* **Fixing a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues),\nor maybe you found your own.\n* **Reviewing a pull request:** there is a list of [PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls).\nLet us know if these look good to you.\n* **Publishing a new package (staff only):** A new npm package should be published regularly, [see below](#publishing-a-new-package-version) for details.\n\n## Validating the data\nYou can use `npm test` to validate data against the schema. You might need to install the devDependencies using `npm install`.\nThe JSON data is validated against the schema using [`ajv`](http://epoberezkin.github.io/ajv/).\n\n## Generating data using the Web API Confluence Dashboard\nIf the feature you're interested in is a JavaScript API, you can cross-reference data against [Web API Confluence](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) using the `confluence` command. This command overwrites data in your current working tree according to data from the dashboard. See [Using Confluence](USING-CONFLUENCE.md) for instructions.\n\n## Test rendering\nYou can use `npm run render $query $dept $aggregateMode` to output the table HTML as it would be rendered on MDN.\nThe parameters are the same as the [`{{compat}}` macro](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/blob/master/macros/Compat.ejs).\n\nPaste the generated HTML into the MDN editor (source mode). You can use a new page, for example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/new and verify if the output looks correct.\n\n## Checklist\nNot everything is enforced or validated by the schema. A few things to pay attention to:\n\n* Feature identifiers (the data namespaces, like `css.properties.background`) should make sense and are spelled correctly.\n* Nesting of feature identifiers should make sense.\n* Notes use correct grammar and spelling. They should be complete sentences ending with a period.\n\n## Code style\n\nThe JSON files should be formatted according to the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.editorconfig) file.\n\n\n## Publishing a new package version\n\nRegularly, a new release of [mdn-browser-compat-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) is created by MDN staff and will then be [deployed to the MDN site](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data#browser-compatibility-tables-on-mdn). Usually this is done every Thursday (MDN never deploys to production on Fridays). Releases should be coordinated with the project owner [Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3), but anyone with merge permissions on the mdn/browser-compat-data repository has the ability to run the following steps which will create a new package version:\n\n 1. Figure out the new version number by looking at [past releases](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases). The project is in alpha, so we're using only patch versions. Lets assume the next version should be `0.0.43`.\n 2. On your updated and clean master branch, run `npm version patch -m \"43rd alpha version\"`. Locally, this updates `package.json`, creates a new commit, and creates a new release tag (see also the docs for [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)).\n 3. Push the commit to master: `git push origin master`.\n 4. Check if the commit passes fine on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data).\n 5. If Travis is alright, push the git tag as well: `git push origin v0.0.43`.\n This step will trigger Travis to publish to npm automatically (see our [.travis.yml file](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.travis.yml)).\n 6. Check [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data) again for the v0.0.43 build and also check [mdn-browser-compat-data on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) to see if `0.0.43` shows up correctly once Travis has finished its work.\n 7. Notify the [#mdndev](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org about the new release and coordinate with jwhitlock or rjohnson a deployment of the new package to the MDN site.\n 8. Create a new [release on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases) by running `npm run release-notes -- v0.0.43`).\n\n## Licensing\n\nPlease note that the compatibility data is made available under the\n[CC0 license](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/LICENSE),\nso any contributions must be compatible with that license. If you're not sure about that, just ask.\n\n## Getting help\n\nIf you need help with this repository or have any questions, contact the MDN team\nin the [#mdn](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or write us on [discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/mdn).\n"

[Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution\n  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)\n\nIssues are where individual reports and Working Group discussions come together such \nthat the eventual consensus can be turned into official specification language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a [GitHub-based pull request contribution workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), \nplease note that **most issues are subject to quite a bit of discussion** before \nthey are ready for a pull request with specific wording changes. Please ensure\nthe full problem space of the issue is explored in the discussion, and that\nconsensus has been reached by the participants, before drafting a pull request.\n\n## Normative and/or substantive contributions\n\nThe CSS Working Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses \nall significant matters prior to implementation.\n\nThe Editors responsible for a particular spec are responsible for triaging their\nissues on a regular basis; however note that sometimes this can take awhile\n(anywhere from a few days to a few years) depending on the complexity of the\nissue and the work schedules of people involved--this does not mean we are\nignoring the issue.\n\nFor an issue that requires WG discussion or approval, WG members can tag/label\nit 'Agenda+' to bring it to the Working Group's attention. Unfortunately,\nGitHub doesn't allow labelling permissions without repository write permissions,\nso if you believe an issue is urgent or discussion has stalled for awhile and\nthe WG's attention is needed to move forward, ask one of the editors to flag it.\n\nThe Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses\nspecifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),\nand in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style.\n\n### After discussion\n\nOnce the Working Group has come to a consensus, the editor may draft up and\ncommit the relevant changes for review by other contributors or a contributor\nmay file a pull request against the issue for review by the editor(s). Since\nspecification wording is tricky, it is strongly recommended that the editors\nof that particular spec be involved, either as originator or as reviewer, in\nany changes. We also encourage other participants in the issue discussion to\nreview the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary.\n\nPlease follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \nwhen contributing to the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nFor normative changes for any specification in\n[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed\nbelow, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR must be\nprovided, except if testing is not practical; for other specifications it is usually appreciated.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the\nspec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please\nexplain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new)\nto follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\nThe pre-CR specifications with this testing requirement are currently:\n\n  * cssom\n  * cssom-view\n\n## Non-substantive contributions\n\nFor simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a\nspecification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.\n\n## Further information\n\nSpecification source files are in [Bikeshed format](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/).\nThe CSSWG wiki has more information on other [CSSWG tooling](https://wiki.csswg.org/tools).\n\nSee [about:csswg](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/)\nfor more information on how the CSSWG operates, delegates authority, and\nmakes decisions. Someday maybe we'll also have a useful official website.\n"

        "contributing": "# Governance and Contribution to the Distributed Tracing working group\n\nThis document describes the contribution and governance rules for the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). This includes the following specifications\n\n- [Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context)\n- [Correlation Context](https://github.com/w3c/correlation-context)\n\n## Interacting with the working group\n\nThe working group encourages all forms of contribution and questions. If you have a question, please open an issue on Github in the specification repository. \n\n## Collaboration under the W3C Process Model\n\nAs the working group is an W3C working group it operates under the [W3C Process Model](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/). All further contribution guidelines only extend the W3C process model. If this document and the process model contradict each other, the W3C process model takes precedence.\n\n\n## Meetings\n\nMeetings follow the [W3C Process Model Guidelines for Meetings](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#GeneralMeetings). This section defines additional meeting guidelines extending these guidelines:\n\n- Official conference calls are held on a bi-weekly basis and are announced on a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dynatrace.com_5a09qhua6fh7jb23h7vdjg6veg%40group.calendar.google.com)\n- Face-to-face topic-based work meetings will be announced at least 4 weeks in advance. Ideally, they are announce 8 weeks in advance as defined in the W3C process model. \n- Proposed changes to any document MUST be handled via a Pull Request (PR). If the change came up during a meeting the meeting owner is responsible for creating the PR.\n- PRs will be reviewed during official meetings, but off-line reviews (LGTMs, NOT LGTMs) and comments are strongly encouraged to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting.\n- If a topic is not defined specifically enough yet to justify a PR against the specification, contributors are encouraged to file an issue. \n- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for a vote over those that appear to require discussions.\n- Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial. Note, administrative PRs that do not materially modify output documents may be processed by admins as needed.\n- PR's can be marked for resolution during a meeting and will be merged when all issues have been addressed and the PR was open for comments for at least one business week. \n- If issues arise after a PR has been merged, the preferred approach is to file a new issue. In rare cases the group can decide to revert a PR.\n\n## Participation  \n\nThere are three categories of project participation:\n\n1. Non Working Group Member. This is anyone who  participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). In contrast to Working Group members they can file a PR but not vote on a PR. They can, however, create issues for specifications. \n2. Working Group Member. This is anyone who officially participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). Working group members can file PRs against documents and can participate in the PR voting procedure. Working Group members need to be employed by a W3C member organization or participate as invited experts. The [W3C process document](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#MemberBenefits) defines the rights of members. \n3. Chairs and Co-Chairs are members of the group but have the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the group. For example, manage the website, github repos and moderate the meetings. Their actions should be done with the knowledge and consent of the group. They also have the ability to merge/close PRs, but only per the group's approval. \n\n## PRs and Voting\n\nSpecificaiton changes are proposed via PRs which are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being merged:\n\n- The author of the PR indicates that it is ready setting a \"ready to review\" tag for review by asking for it to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda document.\n- All comments have been addressed.\n- PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed in dedicated by interested parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.\n\nEvery member of the working group is encouraged to vote with a statement of support and dissent on any PR. If a member has concerns regarding a PR they are encouraged to comment on the issue and join in discussions. If a member does reply to a comment within a reasonable timeframe - one business week - the comment is considered properly addressed. \n\nThe goal of the working group is to reach consensus by discussion. If consensus cannot be reached the [W3C Voting rules](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Votes) apply. \n"

Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!\n\n## Talk with us\n\nTalk with us directly on IRC. Here are some [detailed instructions to connect](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/). The server is `irc.w3.org` and the corresponding channel is `#pub`. If you do not have an IRC client on hand, you can log into the [W3C Public IRC Web Client](http://irc.w3.org/).\n\nDiscuss the publication workflow and related tools [on the mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/).\n\n## Report a bug or suggest a feature idea\n\nStart by looking through the [existing bugs](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to see if this was already discussed earlier. You might even find your solution there.\n\nRemember to update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) often, and the npm dependencies of the project too.\n\nIf you do not find anything, you can help report bugs by [filing them here](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new). Please use the following template when doing so:\n\n```markdown\n##### Issue Type\n\nCan you help us out in labelling this by telling us what kind of ticket this this?\nYou can say \"Bug Report\", \"Feature Idea\" or \"Documentation Report\".\n\n##### Summary\n\nPlease summarize your request in this space. You will earn bonus points for being\nsuccinct, but please add enough detail so we can understand the request. Thanks!\n\n##### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIf this is a bug ticket, please enter the steps you use to reproduce the problem\nin the space below. If this is a feature request, please enter the steps you would\nuse to use the feature. If an example document is useful, please include its URL.\n\n##### Expected Results\n\nPlease enter your expected results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove in the previous section, what did you expect to happen? If showing example\noutput, please surround it with 3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered\ncorrectly.\n\n##### Actual Results\n\nPlease enter your actual results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove, what actually happened? If showing example output, please surround it with\n3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered correctly.\n```\n\n## Contribute to the code\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for offering your help. This is much appreciated.\n\nBefore adding a new feature or submitting a bugfix, please refer to the [existing issues](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to check if it was already discussed before. If it wasn't, please [create a new one](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new) so that we can discuss together about it before you start coding. It would be frustrating for everyone if we had to refuse your contribution because we did not share the same opinion!\n\nTo make sure we are on the same page, you should refer to our [coding style guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-style-guide) and [coding practices guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-practices-guide) before coding.\n\nFinally, we value testing a lot. Before committing anything, make sure the style is respected and the test suite passes by running `npm test`. If you submit a bugfix, try to write tests to reproduce this bug to ensure the same bug will not come up again in the future. And if you submit a new feature, provide tests to ensure the correct behavior of the nominal and edge cases.\n\nA couple of things you should consider before committing and [opening a pull request](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/pulls):\n\n- Regarding your Git commit messages:\n  - Use imperative present tense for commit messages as [suggested in the official documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines).\n  - When commiting a bug fix, start your line with \"Fix #xx\", xx being the issue number. For example: `git commit -m 'Fix #42: Answer the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything'`\n- To ease the merge of pull requests, make sure your branch is up-to-date with `master` when submitting it. Always use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` and `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid merge commits in your submissions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki). You can help us improving it by adding missing pieces, clarifying unclear parts, or asking us to do that.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll contributors to this project agree to follow the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nIf you want to take action, you can contact W3C Staff as explained in [W3C Procedures](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures).\n"

Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties.

You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).\n\nEditorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).\n\nYour concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n\n# Japanese translation (日本語訳)\n\nこの章は，<a href=\"#\">本ファイル (CONTRIBUTING.md) の先頭</a>にある英語表記の公式文書の日本語訳です。日本語訳は参考情報であって、公式な文書ではありません。\n\n## 貢献内容について\n\nこのリポジトリへの貢献内容は、[W3C ソフトウェアと文書のライセンス](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software)に基づき管理されている Internationalization Interest Group および Internationalization Working Group の文書の一部となることが想定されています。このレポジトリにコミットすることによって、あなたはその貢献内容がこのライセンスに基づいて扱われることに同意したことになります。\n\n貢献内容 (プルリクエスト) があなただけの成果でない場合、そのプルリクエストのコメント中にすべての貢献者を明示してください。\n\n貢献者を追加する (あなた自身は自動的に追加されますので、あなた以外について) には、１行に一人を以下のように追加してください:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\n間違って貢献者を追加した場合、コメント中に以下のように記述することで削除できます:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nあなたの貢献が入っていない内容について、誰かほかの人のためにプルリクエストを追加する場合、上記の方法であなた自身を削除できます。\n\n## 著作権について\n\n著作権は標準化活動において非常に重要です。仕様について標準化団体がベンダー非依存性を維持することや、ワーキンググループ内における総意の確認を保護することが可能になります。\n\nW3C 内における著作物作成の途上で、タスクフォース参加者は貢献を行います。それらの貢献内容は共同作業の成果に統合されることで、タスクフォース参加者の貢献により構成される共有著作権が発生します。W3C の仕様書の大半には貢献への謝辞の節が含まれます。\n\nタスクフォース参加者は、その貢献内容に対する著作権に関し W3C の提示するライセンスの元で複製、出版、配布を行うことについて、永続的、非独占的、無償、かつ全世界にわたっての権利とライセンスを W3C に対し承諾します。加えて、タスクフォース参加者は、タスクフォース参加者による貢献を元とする、またはその全部か一部を含む W3C による派生著作物に対し、同一の権利とライセンスを付与するものとし、W3C による派生著作物は W3C のみが所有するものとします。さらに、W3C が追加の承諾や通知なしに、タスクフォース参加者の貢献について、権利侵害への対応を含め著作権所有者としてのあらゆる権利行使ができることに、タスクフォース参加者は同意します。\n\nこの協定により、のちに共同成果に内容が合同されたとしても、タスクフォース参加者が自らの貢献内容について自由に利用することを妨げるものではありません。W3C が成果物を W3C ソフトウェアライセンスや CC-BY といったオープンなライセンスで公開したとしても、タスクフォース参加者がライセンスで容認された権限を執行することに対する制約としてこの協定を適用することはありません。タスクフォース参加者は、彼らが上に述べられた許可を与える権利を法的に所持していることを表明します。もしタスクフォース参加者の貢献内容を含む成果物に対してその雇用者が知的財産権を持つ場合、タスクフォース参加者は、彼らがその雇用者に成り代わり貢献を行うことの許可を得たこと、もしくはその雇用者が W3C への貢献内容に対する権利を放棄したこと、を表明します。\n\n## 品位\n\nタスクフォース参加者は W3C のグループに品位を持って参加しなければなりません。タスクフォース参加者はほかの参加者に中傷、嫌がらせや不愉快になる行動を行ってはなりません。[プロセスドキュメントの 3.1 節](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) および W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) が適用されます。\n\nタスクフォース参加者は未承諾の商用メールやその他の個人的や第三者の宣伝活動を W3C メールリストに流すことを控えるべきです。これは特に公開の W3C グループへタスクフォース参加者がメッセージを流すときに要請されます。\n\n"

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents).

In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n##Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

For implementers and developers who seek a more stable version, [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a right document with which the contributors only focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change and submit `docs/index.bs`. When your pull request is merged, Travis CI will automatically build the spec.\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later.

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

Here we provide some details on how you can contribute. \n\nChanges to the process document tend to fall into a few classes, and how the W3C handles these varies. Simple editorial changes may require little review, but more substantial changes will require a more substantial review and discussions by the W3C community. Please read the material below, and get involved as explained. \n\nIf you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/../../issues).\n\n## Simple Editorial Changes\nFor simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.\n\nSome changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) and we can discuss. \n\n## The W3C Process Community Group\nThe W3C runs a [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), which is an open group created to manage discussions on developing the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Some suggestions for changes to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) will need to be made within the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), please see information below as to whether you need to take your suggestions to the group or can just raise a `pull request` or `issue`.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates but Do Not Change the Policy\nFor changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but do not change policy please do the following:\n\n* [Raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo\n* Make sure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) adds the issue to its agenda. This will allow you to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C (it's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach).\n\nThe best way to ensure your issue gets added to the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agenda is to add yourself to the group, please visit [the group homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) and select the button \"Join or Leave this Group\".\n\nAnother way to ensure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) addressed your issue is to check back on the [issues page](/../../issues) page and ask whether it has been addressed. It is more effective to join the group, but you have this option if you need it. \n\nThe [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) will discuss your issue, and decide whether the change can be made or whether the issue needs to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) for discussion; see the next section for more information on this process.\n\nIf the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agrees the issue does not change the policy and agrees to make the changes detailed in your issue, you may either raise a `pull request` or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. Note: raising a `pull request` **will** be faster. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates and Change the Policy\nFor changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, the idea will need to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings). Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have gained consensus with these two committees.\n\nYou can raise the issue with the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), and you can suggest (or they will notice) that it needs policy discussion and refer it onwards. But you may prefer to initiate that discussion yourself.\n\nGetting something in front of both the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) can be tricky. If your organisation is a W3C member please let your Advisory Committee member know; they will then be able to email the Advisory Committee or bring the issue up at an Advisory Committee meeting. To reach the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) you can [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo (at least two AB members monitor this repo) or send an email to ab@w3.org.\n\nGaining consensus from the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings) will take some time. After consensus has been reached you may either raise a `pull request` which include the changes agreed by these committees or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Edit and Pull Request Instructions\nThis is a very simple repository. To make an edit to the document simply edit the [index.html](index.html) file and send a pull request when your changes are done. If you have the rights to edit this repo your edits will need to be made on a new branch. If you do not have the rights to edit this repo please `fork` the repo, make your edits, then send a `pull request`.\n\nPull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).\n\n## Notes\nPlease feel free to suggest how this document can improve by [raising an issue](/../../issues) on this repo.\n"

In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change.

However, it has happened that different implementation have the same bug, so it's best to read the [standard document](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), and to check what _should_ happen.\n\nFeature requests are welcome, but a quick search in the [opened and closed issues](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues) is welcome to avoid duplicates.\n\nPull requests are also welcome, but any change to the standard (barring things like typos and the like) will have to be discussed in an issue (and possibly during a call, accessible only to W3C Audio Working Group members).\n\n[Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) is the tool used to write this\nspecification.

To make substantive contributions, you must join the Community Group, thus signing the CLA.\n\n## Editing the specification\n\nEdits to the specification are done in the `spec.bs` file, which is then compiled with the [Bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/) spec pre-processor.\n\nTo build the specification, you can use one of:\n\n- `make local`: uses a locally-installed copy of Bikeshed\n- `make remote`: uses a Bikeshed web service, so you don't have to install anything locally\n\n## Reference implementation\n\nWe maintain a reference implementation in the [`reference-implementation/`](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/tree/master/reference-implementation) subfolder. This is currently serving as a prototyping ground before we start working on the formal specification. Eventually we anticipate it co-evolving alongside the specification, in the same was as is done for other standards like Streams, URL, and the MIME type parser.\n\n## Tests\n\nThis specification is not yet far enough along to have [web platform tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt). But soon!\n\nIn the meantime, unit tests that validate individual algorithms accompany the reference implementation, and should be updated as part of it.\n\n## For maintainers: identifying contributors to a pull request\n\nIf the author is not the sole contributor to a pull request, please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than the author, which is automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf the author is  making a pull request on behalf of someone else but they had no part in designing the feature, you can remove them with the above syntax.\n"

Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n# Spec Changes\n\nIf you would like to propose a spec change, please send a PR that changes\n[spec/index.bs][] *and* regenerate [dist/spec/index.html][].\n\nHere's a workflow to get you started:\n\n1.  Fork github.com/WICG/trusted-types\n1.  `git clone` your fork and `cd trusted-types`\n1.  `npm install` to get everything set up.\n1.  Run `git checkout -b your-branch-name` to setup a branch to hold your patch.\n1.  Optionally, [install bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#installing)\n1.  Run `node_modules/.bin/gulp spec.watch` which will regnerate `dist/spec/index.html`\n    every time you modify [spec/index.bs][].\n1.  Open a browser to your local [dist/spec/index.html][].\n1.  Until you're happy, make edits to your local [spec/index.bs][].\n    To help, you might refer to:\n    *   The [bikeshed docs](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/)\n    *   The [bikeshed doc source](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/docs/index.bs)\n        which shows bikeshed in practice.\n    *   The source for the other specifications like\n        [CSP3](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/blob/master/index.src.html)\n1.  Be aware of [issue 112](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/issues/112) if you're\n    having trouble with the watcher.\n1.  Maybe locally enable\n    [`Complain About: broken-links yes`](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/blob/9445a47f720f255d066621ba6975228e558453f5/spec/index.bs#L18)\n    and double check that there are no broken links.\n    Broken-link checking is slooow during development.\n1.  Commit and push your branch to your fork and send us a PR.\n1.  Check the PR to see if bots need you to sign any contributor agreements.\n\nOnce your PR is merged, it'll be available at\nhttps://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/\nbut if you want a shareable link to your PR, try filling in the blanks:\n\n> <tt>https\\://raw.githack.com/<b>\\<YOUR-GITHUB-HANDLE\\></b>/trusted-types/<b>\\<YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\\></b>/dist/spec/index.html</tt>\n\n\n[spec/index.bs]: https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/blob/master/spec/index.bs\n[dist/spec/index.html]: https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/blob/master/dist/spec/index.html\n"

        "license": "CC0 1.0 Universal\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later\nclaims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse\nand redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any\npurposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n"

The Purpose and General Terms of this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This CLA sets forth the terms under which I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification, if any, created by the Project. Any other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/), and if not defined there, in the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Any source code created by the Project is not subject to this CLA, but rather subject to separate licensing terms for that source code. The W3C [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/) governs the operations of the Project. The Community and Business Group Process delegates some rights to the participants of the Project to establish operational agreements. Those operational agreements must not conflict with or modify this Community and Business Group Process, the [Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/cla), or the [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). Except for the limited definitions specifically referenced herein, this CLA and the Final Specification Agreement, if I sign it, set forth my entire licensing obligations for Specifications created by the Project and supersede all prior negotiations, agreements, understandings, and obligations with respect thereto.\n2.  2\\. Copyrights.\n    1.  2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.\n    2.  2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\n3.  3\\. Patents.\n    1.  3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. This requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of payment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. With the exception of the provisions of Section 5 below, W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements obligations made concerning the Specification and described in this CLA are binding on me for the life of the patents in question and encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. I also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of the Specification developed by the Project, provided that my Contribution remains intact in those derivative works. However, no additional claims are made Essential Claims in the combination of my Contribution with derivative works of the Specification.\n    2.  3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make certain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, available by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\n4.  4\\. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\n5.  5\\. Limited Opt-Out. I, in my sole discretion, may withdraw my Contribution, for any reason, by providing written notice of that withdrawal no later than 45 days after the date of my Contribution. Notice of withdrawal of a Contribution must be made in writing using the Project's communications mechanisms for that purpose and must describe the exact material of the particular Contribution being withdrawn. Upon providing that notice, the identified Contribution will be deemed null and void, and, not withstanding anything to the contrary herein, I will not be deemed to have incurred any obligation with respect to that Contribution. In addition, any particular Contribution will be null and void, and I will not incur any obligation as a result of it, if that Contribution is not included in the Specification within 150 days of the date of that Contribution.\n6.  6\\. W3C Community Contributor License Agreement Execution. I acknowledge that the goal of this CLA is to provide coverage for Contributions to the Specification, if any, created by the Project. The Final Specification itself, if any, will be subject to the [W3C Community Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). While I have no legal obligation to execute the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement for any version of the Specification being developed under this CLA, I agree that the selection and terms of the then current W3C Community Final Specification Agreement will not be subject to negotiation.\n7.  7\\. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\n8.  8\\. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this CLA.\n9.  9\\. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. Specifications developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation Track. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no obligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed under the Project transitions to the W3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply:\n    1.  9.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all W3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\n    2.  9.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group.\n        1.  9.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy for my Contributions included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the W3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join a Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free licensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The W3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n        2.  9.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations outside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n10. 10\\. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided mechanisms.\n11. 11\\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that 1) I am legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this CLA and 2) I will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this CLA and I identify any such third party materials. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n12. 12\\. Definitions.\n    1.  12.1. CLA. \"CLA\" means this Contributor Licensing Agreement.\n    2.  12.2. Contribution. \"Contribution\" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that I intentionally submit for inclusion in the Specification, and which Contribution is actually included in the Specification. For the purposes of this definition, the method by which I \"submit\" a Contribution means any form of electronic, oral, or written communication for the purpose of discussing and improving the Specification, but excludes any such communication that I conspicuously designate in writing as not a Contribution to one or more of the Specifications developed by the Project.\n    3.  12.3. Corresponding Working Group. \"Corresponding Working Group\" is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop a Recommendation that takes the Specification as an input.\n    4.  12.4. Essential Claims. \"Essential Claims\" shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction in the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of my Contributions in an implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing the normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the state of the art at the time my Contribution is included in the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and shall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims:\n        1.  12.4.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\n        2.  12.4.2. claims which would be infringed only by:\n            -   portions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\n            -   enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification and are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\n            -   the implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\n        3.  12.4.3. design patents and design registrations.\n\n        For purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural and interoperability requirements. Optional features in the RFC 2119 sense are considered normative unless they are specifically identified as informative. Implementation examples or any other material that merely illustrate the requirements of the Specification are informative, rather than normative.\n\n    5.  12.5. I, Me, or My. \"I,\" \"me,\" or \"my\" refers to the signatory.\n    6.  12.6. Project. \"Project\" means the W3C Community Group or Business Group for which I executed this CLA.\n    7.  12.7. Specification. \"Specification\" means any specification developed by the Project, as of the date my Contribution is first included in that specification. W3C shall provide the authoritative mechanisms for the identification of Specifications created by the Project.\n    8.  12.8. W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. Subject to Section 5, with respect to my Contributions to the Specification, \"W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements\" license shall mean a non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import, and distribute and dispose of implementations of my Contributions in the Specification that:\n        1.  12.8.1. shall be available to all, worldwide, whether or not they are W3C Members;\n        2.  12.8.2. shall extend to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by me;\n        3.  12.8.3. may be limited to implementations of the Specification, and to what is required by the Specification;\n        4.  12.8.4. may be conditioned on a grant of a reciprocal RF license (as defined in this policy) to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by the licensee. A reciprocal license may be required to be available to all, and a reciprocal license may itself be conditioned on a further reciprocal license from all.\n        5.  12.8.5. may not be conditioned on payment of royalties, fees or other consideration;\n        6.  12.8.6. may be suspended with respect to any licensee when licensor issued by licensee for infringement of claims essential to implement the Specification or any W3C Recommendation;\n        7.  12.8.7. may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the use of any technology, intellectual property rights, or other restrictions on behavior of the licensee, but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to operation or maintenance of the license relationship such as the following: choice of law and dispute resolution;\n        8.  12.8.8. shall not be considered accepted by an implementer who manifests an intent not to accept the terms of the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements license as offered by the licensor.\n        9.  12.8.9. The RF license conforming to the requirements in this policy shall be made available by the licensor as long as the Specification is in effect. The term of such license shall be for the life of the patents in question.\n\n        I am encouraged to provide a contact from which licensing information can be obtained and other relevant licensing information. Any such information will be made publicly available.\n\n    9.  12.9. You or Your. \"You,\" \"you,\" or \"your\" means any person or entity who exercises copyright or patent rights granted under this CLA, and any person or entity that person or entity controls."

            "text": "# Contributing to the W3C Process Document\nThank-you for offering to contribute to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Here we provide some details on how you can contribute. \n\nChanges to the process document tend to fall into a few classes, and how the W3C handles these varies. Simple editorial changes may require little review, but more substantial changes will require a more substantial review and discussions by the W3C community. Please read the material below, and get involved as explained. \n\nIf you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/../../issues).\n\n## Simple Editorial Changes\nFor simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.\n\nSome changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) and we can discuss. \n\n## The W3C Process Community Group\nThe W3C runs a [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), which is an open group created to manage discussions on developing the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Some suggestions for changes to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) will need to be made within the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), please see information below as to whether you need to take your suggestions to the group or can just raise a `pull request` or `issue`.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates but Do Not Change the Policy\nFor changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but do not change policy please do the following:\n\n* [Raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo\n* Make sure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) adds the issue to its agenda. This will allow you to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C (it's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach).\n\nThe best way to ensure your issue gets added to the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agenda is to add yourself to the group, please visit [the group homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) and select the button \"Join or Leave this Group\".\n\nAnother way to ensure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) addressed your issue is to check back on the [issues page](/../../issues) page and ask whether it has been addressed. It is more effective to join the group, but you have this option if you need it. \n\nThe [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) will discuss your issue, and decide whether the change can be made or whether the issue needs to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) for discussion; see the next section for more information on this process.\n\nIf the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agrees the issue does not change the policy and agrees to make the changes detailed in your issue, you may either raise a `pull request` or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. Note: raising a `pull request` **will** be faster. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates and Change the Policy\nFor changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, the idea will need to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings). Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have gained consensus with these two committees.\n\nYou can raise the issue with the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), and you can suggest (or they will notice) that it needs policy discussion and refer it onwards. But you may prefer to initiate that discussion yourself.\n\nGetting something in front of both the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) can be tricky. If your organisation is a W3C member please let your Advisory Committee member know; they will then be able to email the Advisory Committee or bring the issue up at an Advisory Committee meeting. To reach the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) you can [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo (at least two AB members monitor this repo) or send an email to ab@w3.org.\n\nGaining consensus from the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings) will take some time. After consensus has been reached you may either raise a `pull request` which include the changes agreed by these committees or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Edit and Pull Request Instructions\nThis is a very simple repository. To make an edit to the document simply edit the [index.html](index.html) file and send a pull request when your changes are done. If you have the rights to edit this repo your edits will need to be made on a new branch. If you do not have the rights to edit this repo please `fork` the repo, make your edits, then send a `pull request`.\n\nPull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).\n\n## Notes\nPlease feel free to suggest how this document can improve by [raising an issue](/../../issues) on this repo.\n"

            "text": "# Contributor Guidelines\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to the [CSS Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) \ndrafts!\n\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track \ndocuments governed by the: \n\n  * [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/)\n  * [Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software)\n\nTo make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\n## Issue disclosure and discussion\n\nThe first step for any substantive contribution is to either:\n\n  1. [Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution\n  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)\n\nIssues are where individual reports and Working Group discussions come together such \nthat the eventual consensus can be turned into official specification language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a [GitHub-based pull request contribution workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), \nplease note that **most issues are subject to quite a bit of discussion** before \nthey are ready for a pull request with specific wording changes. Please ensure\nthe full problem space of the issue is explored in the discussion, and that\nconsensus has been reached by the participants, before drafting a pull request.\n\n## Normative and/or substantive contributions\n\nThe CSS Working Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses \nall significant matters prior to implementation.\n\nThe Editors responsible for a particular spec are responsible for triaging their\nissues on a regular basis; however note that sometimes this can take awhile\n(anywhere from a few days to a few years) depending on the complexity of the\nissue and the work schedules of people involved--this does not mean we are\nignoring the issue.\n\nFor an issue that requires WG discussion or approval, WG members can tag/label\nit 'Agenda+' to bring it to the Working Group's attention. Unfortunately,\nGitHub doesn't allow labelling permissions without repository write permissions,\nso if you believe an issue is urgent or discussion has stalled for awhile and\nthe WG's attention is needed to move forward, ask one of the editors to flag it.\n\nThe Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses\nspecifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),\nand in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style.\n\n### After discussion\n\nOnce the Working Group has come to a consensus, the editor may draft up and\ncommit the relevant changes for review by other contributors or a contributor\nmay file a pull request against the issue for review by the editor(s). Since\nspecification wording is tricky, it is strongly recommended that the editors\nof that particular spec be involved, either as originator or as reviewer, in\nany changes. We also encourage other participants in the issue discussion to\nreview the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary.\n\nPlease follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \nwhen contributing to the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nFor normative changes for any specification in\n[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed\nbelow, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR must be\nprovided, except if testing is not practical; for other specifications it is usually appreciated.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the\nspec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please\nexplain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new)\nto follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\nThe pre-CR specifications with this testing requirement are currently:\n\n  * cssom\n  * cssom-view\n\n## Non-substantive contributions\n\nFor simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a\nspecification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.\n\n## Further information\n\nSpecification source files are in [Bikeshed format](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/).\nThe CSSWG wiki has more information on other [CSSWG tooling](https://wiki.csswg.org/tools).\n\nSee [about:csswg](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/)\nfor more information on how the CSSWG operates, delegates authority, and\nmakes decisions. Someday maybe we'll also have a useful official website.\n"

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license.

This work feeds into the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.  The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is typically hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.\n\n讨论的议题写在[差距分析模板（英文）](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html)中。这项工作源自列出了需要关注文种概要的[文种矩阵](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) 。特别关注于一些用英文撰写的、其他地方难以找到的字体排印特性，比如分词连写、字距、竖排、文本装饰、排版、强调方式等等。我们希望保证我们要能覆盖用户在 CSS、HTML、时间轴文本、网页支付、网页出版等的需要，以及其他 W3C 出台的规范。\n\n### Documents 文档\n\n- [Chinese Layout Gap Analysis | 中文支持差距分析](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/gap-analysis/)\n- [Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求 (ED)](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/) ([WD](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/))\n\n### Following 跟踪\n\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Chinese writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-cjk.)\n\n相比于“Watch”此仓库，订阅 [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) 邮件列表会更好。该列表每天以摘要形式通知此仓库的活动以及其他W3C工作组中与中文书写系统相关的问题。（请使用 GitHub Issues 而不是邮件列表发送反馈，因为 public-i18n-cjk 邮件列表的主要作用是提醒邮件及发布会议纪要。）\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=clreq) page.

(Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n请使用 [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) 提出中文支持的问题、讨论以及对有关文档的反馈。 学习[如何使用GitHub（英文）](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html)。\n\n**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\n**您可以用中文提出问题，但任何实质性讨论都应该在某一阶段用英语进行总结，以便非汉语使用者理解该问题并发表意见。**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings.

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution.

Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works.

The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n##Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties.

It will exist to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Tibetan script on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Tibetan Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/tlreq/)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-tibetan](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-tibetan/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the traditional Tibetan writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-mongolian.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=tibetan) page.

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

            "text": "# Mongolian Layout Task Force (mlreq)\n\nThis group explores gaps and requirements for support of languages using the traditional Mongolian script on the Web and in Digital Publications.\n\nA significant problem faced by the Web is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script or language, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem.\n\nSome experts go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document, or to other documents produced by the group.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work supports the development of the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which indicates hot-spots for language support. The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.\n\n### Documents\n- [Mongolian Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/gap-analysis/) (template only, so far)\n- [Mongolian Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/) (how Mongolian needs to work on the Web & in eBooks)\n- [Mongolian variant forms](https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/) (tracks work on variant encoding discussions)\n- [Encoding discussion document log](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/variants/document-log.html)\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-mongolian](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the traditional Mongolian writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-mongolian.)\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=mongolian) page. (That link applies an `mongolian` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors must read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings.

This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. \n\nWeb が抱えている大きな問題の一つは、エキスパートが彼らの言語のサポートにどのような問題があるかを W3C に伝える方法を知らないこと、反対に、W3C側から聞きたいことがあっても誰に聞けば良いのかが判らないことです。このエキスパートのグループがその問題を大きく解決することを期待しています。\n\nSome experts go a step further, and contribute to the gap-analysis or requirements document, or to other documents produced by the group.\n\n一部のエキスパートの人たちは、一歩進んでこのグループが作成する成果物、例えばギャップの分析や要件定義の文書、その他の文書の作成などに貢献します。\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis document](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/). This work supports the development of the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which indicates hot-spots for language support. The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc.   We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces. \n\nこの場で主に議論すべき項目はギャップ分析文書 [the gap-analysis document](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/) に示されています。その結果は言語サポートにおける重要課題 (hot-spot) を示す [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) の開発に貢献します。議論において特に重要なのは英語で情報を得ることの難しい組版の機能についてです。例えば行揃え、文字間隔、縦書き、文字の修飾、ページ構成、強調の方法、等です。W3C は W3C が開発するさまざまな仕様書、例えば CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing 等が、それぞれの地域で必要な機能を必ず取り込んでいるようにしたいと考えています。\n\n### Documents（文書）\n- [Japanese Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/) （日本語ギャップ分析） \n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/) (Editor's copy)\n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/) (Working Group Note)\n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-jlreq-20120403/ja/) (Japanese version、日本語版)\n\n### Following（参加する方法）\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about activity in this repository, but also about any activity for other W3C Working Group issues related to Japanese, Chinese and Korean. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to that list).\n\nJLReq タスクフォースに参加するには [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) メーリングリストに参加するのがベストです。メーリングリストは1日1回、JLReq GitHub で起こっている議論をまとめて伝えます。W3C の他のグループで日本語、中国語、韓国語に関係する議論が行われていたらその内容も伝えます。（フィードバックを送るにはメーリングリストではなく GitHub issues を使ってください。この public-i18n-cjk リストの主な目的は通知です。会議録もこのリストに送られます）\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=jlreq) page. (That link applies a `japanese` filter.)\n\nJLReq タスクフォースや他の Working Group の日本語に関する未解決の問題（open issues）は [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=jlreq) のページで見ることができます。\n\n### Contributing（参加する方法）\nAll contributors must read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n全ての参加者は  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) を読み、それに同意する必要があります。\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues) to to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n日本語に関する問題の報告、議論や文書へのフィードバックには [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues) を使ってください（[GitHub issues の使い方](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html)（英語））\n\n**You may raise issues in Japanese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Japanese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\n**GitHub issues での議論は日本語で構いません。ただし重要な議論が日本語で行われた場合は、日本語の判らないメンバーが議論を理解しコメントできるよう、適当な時点で英語での要約が必要です。**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings.

            "text": "# Hebrew Script Layout Task Force (hlreq)\n\nThis group exists to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Hebrew script on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Hebrew Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/hlreq/gap-analysis)\n- [Hebrew Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/hlreq/)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/hlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-hebrew](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-hebrew/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Hebrew writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-hebrew.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=hebrew) page. (That link applies an `hebrew` filter.)\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/hlreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a task force member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org). We welcome participation requests.\n\n### Links\n- [Issue tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=hebrew)\n- [Github issues](https://github.com/w3c/hlreq/issues)\n- [Home Page](https://w3c.github.io/hlreq/homepage/)\n- [Charter](http://w3c.github.io/hlreq/charter/)\n- [Action tracker](https://www.w3.org/International/groups/hebrew-layout/track/actions/open)\n- [Writing i18n tests](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Writing-i18n-tests)\n- [Practical tips for task forces](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/process.html) (See also the github and editorial guidelines below)\n- [Meeting info](https://www.w3.org/2017/07/hlreq-meeting-info.html)\n- [Mail archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-hebrew/)\n- Contacts: Shervin Afshar, Behnam Esfahbod, [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org)\n\n### Links for editors\nIf you edit a document, you should be familiar with and use the following:\n\n- [Github guidelines for working with i18n documents](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/github)\n- [Editorial guidelines for working with i18n documents](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/editing)\n\nThe following templates are available:\n- [Gap analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html)\n- [Requirements document template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/lreq_doc/gap-analysis_template.html)\n\n### Links to background information\nThe following information describes work going on at the W3C to support languages on the Web.\n- [Language support heatmap](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html)\n- [Analysing support for text layout on the Web](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web)\n- [Overview of language enablement work in progress](https://www.w3.org/International/layout)\n- [Setting up a Gap Analysis Project](https://github.com/w3c/typography/wiki/Setting-up-a-Gap-Analysis-Project)\n- [Internationalization Sponsorship Program](https://www.w3.org/International/sponsorship/)\n"

Any comments below that image and its metadata should only refer to the image itself (eg. suitability, clarification, etc), and not lead to a general discussion about the feature illustrated. Those discussions should be moved elsewhere.\n\n## How to find a sample\nUse the **[Visual Index](https://w3c.github.io/type-samples/)** (Currently still a prototype.)\n\nClick on a radio button in the right column to select what type of image you are interested in. Refine it by script/medium, if you want. Click on a thumbnail to see the image with metadata.\n\nWhen looking at an issue, you can click on the image to see a larger version.\n\n## How to submit an image\n\n_Warning: The current setup is experimental, and may change if a more effective method is found._\n\nIf you want to submit an image to the repo please raise an issue and follow these instructions. \n\nBy submitting an image you indicate that you agree to be bound by the stipulations in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/type-samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md). The repo is moderated.  If an image submission is accepted, the moderator will add the labels that make the issue visible in the index, but may edit the title and body text you provided before doing so.\n\n### The issue title\n\nShould have the following structure:\n```\n<script-tag> <lang-tag> <media-label> <one or more space-separated feature-labels>\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nhebr he newsprint justification text-decoration\n```\n\nThe script and lang tags should be those in BCP-47. [Find a tag](http://r12a.github.io/apps/subtags/).\n\nThe `<media-label>` should be one of the following (the list is likely to grow over time). There should only be ONE feature label in the issue title.\n`book, inscription, magazine, mockup, newsprint, printedmatter, signage, software, webpage, other`\n\nThere should be only ONE `feature-label` per line in the issue body, but ALL feature labels used in the body should appear at the end of the title (space separated).  Feature labels should be one of the following.\n`abbreviation bidi-text emphasis font-style fonts glyphs-diacritics hyphenation initial-letter inline-spacing justification lists notes-footnotes numbers punctuation quotations ruby text-decoration vertical-text`\n\nIf you need something different, leave a note in the body of the issue.\n\n### The issue body\n\nShould start with an image. **There should only be one image per issue.** You should drag and drop the image into the issue, rather than point to it with a link.\n\nAfter the image, use the following syntax:\n\n```\n---\ntag: <feature-label> <short description>\n[possibly more lines like that just above]\nsource: <description of the source of the image, and a link for online resources>\n---\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\n---\ntag: font-style Oblique-styled text leaning to the left.\ntag: abbreviation Heh with joining form and extended baseline in date.\nsource: Asharq al Awsat, p1, 12 Dec 1994\n---\n```\n\nDescriptions should be short and succinct, like titles. They should indicate what the image illustrates.\n\nYou can add descriptive text below, if really needed.  It's also helpful to provide a text transcription of the content in the image for those who want to create tests, so that they can copy and paste the text.\n\nYou won't be able to add github labels. They will be applied for you. And you shouldn't need to use pull requests.\n\n**Note:** This compilation is made available under the [Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

            "text": "# TTML2 Test Suites\n\nThe TTML2 Test Suites consist of a validation test suite and a presentation test suite. The purpose of these test suites is to demonstrate adequate implementation experience of each (designated) feature of the [TTML2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/) as documented by the [TTML2 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML2ImplementationReport). An ancillary purpose is to promote ineroperability between implementations.\n\nThe tests found in these test suites focus on functionality and constraints thereof that derive directly from normative text in the [TTML2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/). Additional tests that go beyond the normative specification text are included here as well; however, though such tests are useful for wider interoperability testing, the results from their exercise are not reported in the [TTML2 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML2ImplementationReport). See also [Excluded Tests](#excluded-tests).\n\n## Validation Test Suite\n\nThe validation test suite is found under the `validation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for valid content (validity tests) and (2) tests for invalid content (invalidity tests). The result of each test can be characterized as PASS or FAIL.\n\nA PASS result for a validity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for a validity test occurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false negative_ result.\n\nA PASS result for an invalidity test occcurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for an invalidity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false positive_ result.\n\nA validator is considered to **_strictly pass_** the test suite if it does not report a false negative for any validity test. A validator is considered to **_fully pass_** the test suite if it (1) strictly passes the test suite and (2) does not report a false positive for any invalidity test.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting an implementation of the validation function for a specific (designated) feature, the implementation must strictly pass all tests for that feature; however, it is not required to fully pass all tests for that feature since the TTML2 specification does not require a validator to detect all possibile invalidities, about which see [validate document](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/#semantics-procedure-validate-document).\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `validation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML2 feature designator, lists validity and invalidity tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *validation test manifest*.\n\n## Presentation Test Suite\n\nThe presentation test suite is found under the `presentation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for presenting valid content and (2) tests for presenting invalid content.\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `presentation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML2 feature designator, lists presentation tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *presentation test manifest*.\n\nFor tests having primarily visual presentation semantics, each presentation test is associated with a like named ZIP archive with the suffix `.expected.zip`, which contains the output of a particular reference implementation (TTPE). Each such _reference archive_ contains a manifest file and one or more image frames represented in some image format. In the present form of the reference archives, the image format is `image/svg+xml`. These image frames should **not** be construed as normative, but merely serve as a possible reference image for performing (human visual) comparisons of expected output.\n\n## Excluded Tests\n\nAs noted above, the two (validation and presentation) test manifests employ an *exclusion* flag to denote that a test is excluded from exit criteria consideration. The tests marked as excluded (presently) consist of tests that may be useful for testing implementations, but are not necessarily derived from normative specification language, as well as tests for which there is some question as to whether they correctly represent normative specification requirements. In both cases, these tests may, but need not be exercised by implementations, and there is no expectation that the results from such tests will be reported by implementors.\n\n## Pending Tests\n\nTests located in the `pending` directory are under consideration for future addition to the test suite. They are not considered part of the formal test suite at this time; furthermore, there is no (fixed) schedule for their addition (or not) to the test suite.\n\n## Test Annotation Attributes\n\nIn addition to standard, TTML2 defined attributes, each test contains certain tool-specific annotation attributes in a namespace associated with the `ttva` prefix. These attributes are used by a certain reference implementation, [TTV](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv), to facilitate the testing process. Note that TTML2 content processing requires processors to prune (ignore) unrecognized namespace qualified attributes. See [Annotations](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv#annotations) for further information on their usage.\n"

            "text": "# TTML3 Test Suites\n\nThe TTML3 Test Suites consist of a validation test suite and a presentation test suite. The purpose of these test suites is to demonstrate adequate implementation experience of each (designated) feature of the [TTML3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/) as documented by the [TTML3 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML3ImplementationReport). An ancillary purpose is to promote ineroperability between implementations.\n\nThe tests found in these test suites focus on functionality and constraints thereof that derive directly from normative text in the [TTML3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/). Additional tests that go beyond the normative specification text are included here as well; however, though such tests are useful for wider interoperability testing, the results from their exercise are not reported in the [TTML3 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML3ImplementationReport). See also [Excluded Tests](#excluded-tests).\n\n## Validation Test Suite\n\nThe validation test suite is found under the `validation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for valid content (validity tests) and (2) tests for invalid content (invalidity tests). The result of each test can be characterized as PASS or FAIL.\n\nA PASS result for a validity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for a validity test occurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false negative_ result.\n\nA PASS result for an invalidity test occcurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for an invalidity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false positive_ result.\n\nA validator is considered to **_strictly pass_** the test suite if it does not report a false negative for any validity test. A validator is considered to **_fully pass_** the test suite if it (1) strictly passes the test suite and (2) does not report a false positive for any invalidity test.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting an implementation of the validation function for a specific (designated) feature, the implementation must strictly pass all tests for that feature; however, it is not required to fully pass all tests for that feature since the TTML3 specification does not require a validator to detect all possibile invalidities, about which see [validate document](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/#semantics-procedure-validate-document).\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `validation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML3 feature designator, lists validity and invalidity tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *validation test manifest*.\n\n## Presentation Test Suite\n\nThe presentation test suite is found under the `presentation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for presenting valid content and (2) tests for presenting invalid content.\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `presentation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML3 feature designator, lists presentation tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *presentation test manifest*.\n\nFor tests having primarily visual presentation semantics, each presentation test is associated with a like named ZIP archive with the suffix `.expected.zip`, which contains the output of a particular reference implementation (TTPE). Each such _reference archive_ contains a manifest file and one or more image frames represented in some image format. In the present form of the reference archives, the image format is `image/svg+xml`. These image frames should **not** be construed as normative, but merely serve as a possible reference image for performing (human visual) comparisons of expected output.\n\n## Excluded Tests\n\nAs noted above, the two (validation and presentation) test manifests employ an *exclusion* flag to denote that a test is excluded from exit criteria consideration. The tests marked as excluded (presently) consist of tests that may be useful for testing implementations, but are not necessarily derived from normative specification language, as well as tests for which there is some question as to whether they correctly represent normative specification requirements. In both cases, these tests may, but need not be exercised by implementations, and there is no expectation that the results from such tests will be reported by implementors.\n\n## Pending Tests\n\nTests located in the `pending` directory are under consideration for future addition to the test suite. They are not considered part of the formal test suite at this time; furthermore, there is no (fixed) schedule for their addition (or not) to the test suite.\n\n## Test Annotation Attributes\n\nIn addition to standard, TTML3 defined attributes, each test contains certain tool-specific annotation attributes in a namespace associated with the `ttva` prefix. These attributes are used by a certain reference implementation, [TTV](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv), to facilitate the testing process. Note that TTML3 content processing requires processors to prune (ignore) unrecognized namespace qualified attributes. See [Annotations](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv#annotations) for further information on their usage.\n"

This reel was created with the same scope as the original reel, where the items that are tested are all pertinent to subtitles produced for production content. This version adds numerous additional tests that focus on foreign language rendering, color compositing to different color spaces, and some new IMSC 1.1 attributes. Like the original reel, this has been built to help manufacturers with their IMSC 1.1 Text implementations by providing them with a reference IMSC package.\n\nThis test content includes the following assets:\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29.xml\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec709_Backplate.mov*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec709_CompositedProxy.mp4*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec2020-PQ_Backplate.mov*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec2020-PQ_CompositedProxy.mp4*\n\n    **Please note that these media files are hosted at https://media.w3.org/, and are linked to via .URL  internet shortcut files.*\n\nThe IMSC XML file is to be rendered over the Backplate ProRes HQ file. If the IMSC decoding is accurate, it will look approximately the same as the Composited Proxy file. It is acceptable for there to be slight differences in text rendering, since the proportionalSansSerif font chosen by the renderer may be different than what was used for the proxy. There is both a Rec 709 backplate and proxy, along with a Rec 2020 PQ backplate and proxy. The recommended approach for compositing sRGB subtitles to rec 709 and rec 2020 PQ is:\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to 709 Full Range (EOTF 2.4)\n    No conversion is required.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to 709 Narrow Range (EOTF 2.4)\n    Scale the sRGB values to narrow range as described in section 6 of RP 2077:2013.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to PQ 2020 Full Range (EOTF PQ)\n    Map the sRGB values to PQ 2020 Full Range as described in section Q.1 of the TTML2 Recommendation.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to PQ 2020 Narrow Range (EOTF PQ)\n    Map the sRGB values to PQ 2020 Full Range as described in section Q.1 of the TTML2 Recommendation,\n    then scale those values to narrow range as described in section 6 of RP 2077:2013.\n\nThe IMSC 1.1 XML file includes in-line comments which describes the purpose of each test.\n\nThe backplate includes the following:\n- Frame counter and Media Time counter\n- Grid with lines every 5%\n- Yellow crosses at each corner of the region\n- Sync counter at the beginning and end of each event\n"

            "text": "WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)\n===\n\nPlease do not submit any new pull requests against this branch - please look in the list of branches for the most current Working Branch and use that one.\n\nThis repository is used to develop content for WCAG 2, as well as associated understanding documents and techniques.\n\n## File Structure\n\nWCAG 2.0 was maintained in a different file structure than subsequent versions of WCAG. Source files for WCAG 2.0 are in the wcag20 folder and exists primarily for archival purposes. Do not edit content in that folder.\n\nContent for WCAG 2.1 and later is organized accordign to the file structure below. The WCAG repository contains source and auxiliary files for WCAG 2, Understanding WCAG 2, and eventually techniques. It also contains auxiliary files that support automated formatting of the document. To facilitate multi-party editing, each success criterion is in a separate file, consisting of a HTML fragment that can be included into the main guidelines. Key files include:\n\n* guidelines/index.html - the main guidelines file\n* guidelines/sc/<version>/*.html - files for each success criterion\n* guidelines/terms/<version>/*.html - files for each definition\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - understanding files for each success criterion\n\nWhere <version> is \"20\", content came from WCAG 2.0. \"21\" is used for content introduced in WCAG 2.1, \"22\" for WCAG 2.2, etc.\n\n## Editing Draft Success Criteria\n\n[Success Criteria Managers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/SC_Managers_Phase1) will prepare candidate success criteria, ready for inclusion in the guidelines document. To prepare success criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), using the URI https://github.com/w3c/wcag.git to clone.\n1. Switch to the working branch for the proposal, which is named for the shortname of the draft success criterion and the issue number, concatenated together.\n1. Find the appropriate file for the success criterion in the guidelines/sc/21 folder, named the same as the start of the branch name, and open in an HTML-capable editor. Do the same with any definitions referenced by the success criterion, in the guidelines/terms/21 folder.\n1. Open the guidelines/index.html file and remove comment marks around the lines that reference the success criterion and terms you have edited..\n1. Follow the [success criteria format](#user-content-success-criteria-format) below to create the SC content.\n1. Save the file and commit the change. NOTE: It is important to also add a suitable 'commit message'. In the comments, reference the issue number from which the proposal was developed starting with a hash, e.g., `#1`. \n1. When the success criterion is ready for Working Group review, inform the chairs. Once the proposal has been accepted by the Working Group, the editors will merge the working branch into the master branch, which puts it in the editors' draft and eventual Technical Report publication.\n\n### Success Criteria Format\n\nSuccess criteria use a simple structure of HTML elements, with a few class attribute values, to ensure consistency. Enhancement scripts and style key off this structure. Content you provide is indicated in braces. Items after comments are optional.\n\n```html\n<section class=\"sc\">\n\t<h4>{SC Handle}</h4>\n\t<p class=\"conformance-level\">{Level}</p>\n\t<p class=\"change\">{Change}</p>\n\t<p>{Main SC Text}</p>\n\t<!-- if SC has sub-points -->\n\t<dl>\n\t\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t\t<dd>{Point Text}</dd>\n\t</dl>\n\t<!-- if SC has notes -->\n\t<p class=\"note\">{Note}</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote you do not provide the SC number. Numbers will be assigned, and most likely automatically generated, later.\n\nValues you provide are described below. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors) for an example of each of these pieces of content.\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>{SC Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>The short name of the SC. In SC 2.2.1 this is \"Timing Adjustable\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Level}</dt>\n\t<dd>The conformance level of the SC. Values can be \"A\", \"AA\", or \"AAA\". Do not include the word \"Level\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Change}</dt>\n\t<dd>Indicate whether the SC is unchanged from WCAG 2.0, changed, or new. Values can be \"Unchanged\", \"Changed\", or \"New\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Main SC Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The main text of the SC, or the starting paragraph. In SC 2.2.1 this is the content that begins \"For each time limit...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>If the SC has bullets, each bullet has a handle. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point handle is \"Turn off\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The content of the bullet. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point text begins \"The user is allowed...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Note}</dt>\n\t<dd>If there is a note to the SC, provide it after the other content (without the starter \"Note\"). In SC 2.2.1, this is the content that begins \"This success criterion...\". If there is more than one note, multiple `<p class=\"note\">`elements may be provided.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Definitions\n\nIf you providing term definitions along with your SC, include them in the glossary. Position them in the appropriate alphabetical order with the rest of the terms and use the following format:\n\n```html\n<dt><dfn>{Term}</dfn></dt>\n<dd>{Definition}</dd>\n```\n\nThe ```dfn``` element tells the script that this is a term and causes special styling and linking features. To link to a term, use an `<a>` element without an `href` attribute; if the link text is the same as the term, the link will be correctly generated. For example, if there is a term `<dfn>web page</dfn>` on the page, a link in the form of `<a>web page</a>` will result in a proper link. If the link text has a different form from the canonical term, e.g., \"web pages\" (note the plural), you can provide a hint on the term definition with the `data-lt` attribute. In this example, modify the term to be `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages\">web page</dfn>`. Multiple alternate names for the term can be separated with pipe characters, with no leading or trailing space, e.g., `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages|page|pages\">web page</dfn>`.\n\n## Editing Draft Understanding Content\n\nThere is one Understanding file per success criterion, plus an index:\n\n* understanding/index.html - index page, need to uncomment or add a reference to individual Understanding pages as they are made available\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - files for each understanding page, named the same as the success criterion file in the guidelines\n\nFiles are populated with a template that provides the expected structure. Leave the template structure in place, and add content as appropriate within the sections. Elements with class=\"instructions\" provide guidance about what content to include in that section; you can remove those elements if you want but don't have to. The template for examples proposes either a bullet list or a series of sub-sections, choose one of those approaches and remove the other from the template. The template for techniques includes sub-sections for \"situations\", remove that wrapper section if not needed.\n\nUnderstanding files are referenced from the relevant Success Criterion on the WCAG specification; these links are put in by the script.\n\nThe formal publication location for Understanding pages is currently https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/. This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids.\n\n### Technique File Structure\n\nThe [technique template](techniques/technique-template.html) shows the structure of techniques. Main sections are in top-level &lt;section> elements with specific IDs: meta, applicability, description, examples, tests, related, resources. The description and tests sections are required; the applicability and examples sections are recommended; the related and resources sections are optional. The meta section provides context for the technique during authoring but is removed for publication. The title of the technique is in the `<h1>` element. Elements with `class=\"instructions\"` provide information about populating the template. They should be removed as the technique is developed but if not removed, will be ignored by the generator. **Do not copy `class=\"instructions\"` on real content.**\n\nTechniques can use a temporary style sheet to facilitate review of drafts. This style sheet is replaced by other style sheets and structure for formal publication. To use this style sheet, add `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../css/editors.css\"/>` to the head of the technique.\n\nThe generator used to publish techniques uses XML processing, so techniques must be well-formed XML. Techniques use HTML 5 structure so are actually [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/).  \n\n### Images, Examples, Cross References for Techniques\n\nTechniques can include images. Place the image file in the `img` folder of the relevant technology - meaning all techniques for a technology share a common set of images. Use a relative link to load the image. Most images should be loaded with a `<figure>` element and labeled with a `<figcaption>` positioned at the bottom of the figure. Small inline images may be loaded with a `<img>` element with suitable `alt` text.\n\nTechniques should include brief code examples to demonstrate how to author content that follows the technique. Code examples should be easy to read, and usually not complete content in themselves. More complete examples can be provided as [working examples](#user-content-provide-working-examples-of-techniques) (see below). Link to working examples at the bottom of each example, in a `<p class=\"working-example\">` element, containing a relative link to `../../working-examples/{example-name}/`.\n\nCross references to other techniques may be provided where useful. Generally they should be provided in the \"Related Techniques\" section but can be provided elsewhere. Use a relative link to reference the technique, `{Technique ID}` if the same technology, or `../{Technology}/{Technique ID}` otherwise. If the technique is still under development and does not have a formal ID, reference the path to the development file. If the technique is under development in a different branch, use an absolute URI to the rawgit version of the technique.\n\nCross references to guidelines and success criteria should use a relative URI to the *Understanding* page for that item. Cross references to other parts of the guidelines should use an absolute URI to the guidelines as published on the W3C TR page, a URI beginning with `https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#`. Note that references to guidelines or success criteria to which techniques relate are added by the generator upon publication based on information in the Understanding documents, so redundant links to those is not normally needed or advised.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n[General priorities and process to work on techniques are maintained in the wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Wcag21-techniques).\n\nNew techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. Editors will assign the technique an ID and rename the file when it is accepted by the Working Group. For example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename. The editors will assign it a formal ID, and rename the file, when it is accepted by the Working Group.\n\nEach new technique should be created in a new branch. Set-up of the branch and file is automated via the create-techniques.sh script, which can be run with bash. The command line is:\n\n```Shell\nbash create-techniques.sh <technology> <filename> <type> \"<title>\"\n```\n\\<technology> is the technology directory for the technique\n\\<filename> is the temporary filename (without extension) for the technique\n\\<type> is \"technique\" or \"failure\"\n\\<title> is the title of the technique, enclosed in quotes and escaping special characters with \\\\\n\nThis automates the following steps:\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n\nOnce a technique branch and file is set up, populate the content and request review:\n\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, make a pull request into master.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Formatting Techniques\n\nTechniques in the repository are plain HTML files with minimal formatting. For publication to the editors' draft and W3C location, techniques are formatted by an XSLT-based generator managed by Apache Ant running in Java. Most people do not need to worry about this, but relevant files are the [Ant build file](build.xml) and [XSLT files](xslt).\n\nThe generator compiles the techniques together as a suite with formatting and navigation. It enforces certain structures, such as ordering top-level sections described above and standardizing headings. It attempts to process cross reference links to make sure the URIs work upon publication. One of the most substantial roles is to populate the Applicability section with references to the guidelines or success criteria to which the technique relates. The information for this comes from the Understanding documents. Proper use of the technique template is important to enable this functionality, and mal-formed techniques may cause the generator to fail.\n\n## Working Examples\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n"

Source files for WCAG 2.0 are in the wcag20 folder and exists primarily for archival purposes. Do not edit content in that folder.\n\nContent for WCAG 2.1 and later is organized accordign to the file structure below. The WCAG repository contains source and auxiliary files for WCAG 2, Understanding WCAG 2, and eventually techniques. It also contains auxiliary files that support automated formatting of the document. To facilitate multi-party editing, each success criterion is in a separate file, consisting of a HTML fragment that can be included into the main guidelines. Key files include:\n\n* guidelines/index.html - the main guidelines file\n* guidelines/sc/<version>/*.html - files for each success criterion\n* guidelines/terms/<version>/*.html - files for each definition\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - understanding files for each success criterion\n\nWhere <version> is \"20\", content came from WCAG 2.0. \"21\" is used for content introduced in WCAG 2.1, \"22\" for WCAG 2.2, etc.\n\n## Editing Draft Success Criteria\n\n[Success Criteria Managers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/SC_Managers_Phase1) will prepare candidate success criteria, ready for inclusion in the guidelines document. To prepare success criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), using the URI https://github.com/w3c/wcag21.git to clone.\n1. Switch to the working branch for the proposal, which is named for the shortname of the draft success criterion and the issue number, concatenated together.\n1. Find the appropriate file for the success criterion in the guidelines/sc/21 folder, named the same as the start of the branch name, and open in an HTML-capable editor. Do the same with any definitions referenced by the success criterion, in the guidelines/terms/21 folder.\n1. Open the guidelines/index.html file and remove comment marks around the lines that reference the success criterion and terms you have edited..\n1. Follow the [success criteria format](#user-content-success-criteria-format) below to create the SC content.\n1. Save the file and commit the change. NOTE: It is important to also add a suitable 'commit message'. In the comments, reference the issue number from which the proposal was developed starting with a hash, e.g., `#1`. \n1. When the success criterion is ready for Working Group review, inform the chairs. Once the proposal has been accepted by the Working Group, the editors will merge the working branch into the master branch, which puts it in the editors' draft and eventual Technical Report publication.\n\n### Success Criteria Format\n\nSuccess criteria use a simple structure of HTML elements, with a few class attribute values, to ensure consistency. Enhancement scripts and style key off this structure. Content you provide is indicated in braces. Items after comments are optional.\n\n```html\n<section class=\"sc\">\n\t<h4>{SC Handle}</h4>\n\t<p class=\"conformance-level\">{Level}</p>\n\t<p class=\"change\">{Change}</p>\n\t<p>{Main SC Text}</p>\n\t<!-- if SC has sub-points -->\n\t<dl>\n\t\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t\t<dd>{Point Text}</dd>\n\t</dl>\n\t<!-- if SC has notes -->\n\t<p class=\"note\">{Note}</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote you do not provide the SC number. Numbers will be assigned, and most likely automatically generated, later.\n\nValues you provide are described below. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors) for an example of each of these pieces of content.\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>{SC Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>The short name of the SC. In SC 2.2.1 this is \"Timing Adjustable\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Level}</dt>\n\t<dd>The conformance level of the SC. Values can be \"A\", \"AA\", or \"AAA\". Do not include the word \"Level\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Change}</dt>\n\t<dd>Indicate whether the SC is unchanged from WCAG 2.0, changed, or new. Values can be \"Unchanged\", \"Changed\", or \"New\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Main SC Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The main text of the SC, or the starting paragraph. In SC 2.2.1 this is the content that begins \"For each time limit...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>If the SC has bullets, each bullet has a handle. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point handle is \"Turn off\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The content of the bullet. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point text begins \"The user is allowed...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Note}</dt>\n\t<dd>If there is a note to the SC, provide it after the other content (without the starter \"Note\"). In SC 2.2.1, this is the content that begins \"This success criterion...\". If there is more than one note, multiple `<p class=\"note\">`elements may be provided.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Definitions\n\nIf you providing term definitions along with your SC, include them in the glossary. Position them in the appropriate alphabetical order with the rest of the terms and use the following format:\n\n```html\n<dt><dfn>{Term}</dfn></dt>\n<dd>{Definition}</dd>\n```\n\nThe ```dfn``` element tells the script that this is a term and causes special styling and linking features. To link to a term, use an `<a>` element without an `href` attribute; if the link text is the same as the term, the link will be correctly generated. For example, if there is a term `<dfn>web page</dfn>` on the page, a link in the form of `<a>web page</a>` will result in a proper link. If the link text has a different form from the canonical term, e.g., \"web pages\" (note the plural), you can provide a hint on the term definition with the `data-lt` attribute. In this example, modify the term to be `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages\">web page</dfn>`. Multiple alternate names for the term can be separated with pipe characters, with no leading or trailing space, e.g., `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages|page|pages\">web page</dfn>`.\n\n## Editing Draft Understanding Content\n\nThere is one Understanding file per success criterion, plus an index:\n\n* understanding/index.html - index page, need to uncomment or add a reference to individual Understanding pages as they are made available\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - files for each understanding page, named the same as the success criterion file in the guidelines\n\nFiles are populated with a template that provides the expected structure. Leave the template structure in place, and add content as appropriate within the sections. Elements with class=\"instructions\" provide guidance about what content to include in that section; you can remove those elements if you want but don't have to. The template for examples proposes either a bullet list or a series of sub-sections, choose one of those approaches and remove the other from the template. The template for techniques includes sub-sections for \"situations\", remove that wrapper section if not needed.\n\nUnderstanding files are referenced from the relevant Success Criterion on the WCAG specification; these links are put in by the script.\n\nThe formal publication location for Understanding pages is currently https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/. This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids. Techniques previously published for WCAG 2.0 are currently have the assigned ID of the technique as the filename, but new techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. \n\nFor example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, ask the chairs to arrange WG review and merge.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Provide Working Examples of Techniques\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n"

The Purpose and General Terms of this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This CLA sets forth the terms under which I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification, if any, created by the Project. Any other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/), and if not defined there, in the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Any source code created by the Project is not subject to this CLA, but rather subject to separate licensing terms for that source code. The W3C [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/) governs the operations of the Project. The Community and Business Group Process delegates some rights to the participants of the Project to establish operational agreements. Those operational agreements must not conflict with or modify this Community and Business Group Process, the [Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/cla), or the [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). Except for the limited definitions specifically referenced herein, this CLA and the Final Specification Agreement, if I sign it, set forth my entire licensing obligations for Specifications created by the Project and supersede all prior negotiations, agreements, understandings, and obligations with respect thereto.\n2.  2\\. Copyrights.\n    1.  2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.\n    2.  2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\n3.  3\\. Patents.\n    1.  3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. This requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of payment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. With the exception of the provisions of Section 5 below, W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements obligations made concerning the Specification and described in this CLA are binding on me for the life of the patents in question and encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. I also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of the Specification developed by the Project, provided that my Contribution remains intact in those derivative works. However, no additional claims are made Essential Claims in the combination of my Contribution with derivative works of the Specification.\n    2.  3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make certain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, available by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\n4.  4\\. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\n5.  5\\. Limited Opt-Out. I, in my sole discretion, may withdraw my Contribution, for any reason, by providing written notice of that withdrawal no later than 45 days after the date of my Contribution. Notice of withdrawal of a Contribution must be made in writing using the Project's communications mechanisms for that purpose and must describe the exact material of the particular Contribution being withdrawn. Upon providing that notice, the identified Contribution will be deemed null and void, and, not withstanding anything to the contrary herein, I will not be deemed to have incurred any obligation with respect to that Contribution. In addition, any particular Contribution will be null and void, and I will not incur any obligation as a result of it, if that Contribution is not included in the Specification within 150 days of the date of that Contribution.\n6.  6\\. W3C Community Contributor License Agreement Execution. I acknowledge that the goal of this CLA is to provide coverage for Contributions to the Specification, if any, created by the Project. The Final Specification itself, if any, will be subject to the [W3C Community Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). While I have no legal obligation to execute the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement for any version of the Specification being developed under this CLA, I agree that the selection and terms of the then current W3C Community Final Specification Agreement will not be subject to negotiation.\n7.  7\\. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\n8.  8\\. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this CLA.\n9.  9\\. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. Specifications developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation Track. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no obligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed under the Project transitions to the W3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply:\n    1.  9.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all W3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\n    2.  9.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group.\n        1.  9.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy for my Contributions included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the W3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join a Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free licensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The W3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n        2.  9.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations outside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n10. 10\\. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided mechanisms.\n11. 11\\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that 1) I am legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this CLA and 2) I will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this CLA and I identify any such third party materials. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n12. 12\\. Definitions.\n    1.  12.1. CLA. \"CLA\" means this Contributor Licensing Agreement.\n    2.  12.2. Contribution. \"Contribution\" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that I intentionally submit for inclusion in the Specification, and which Contribution is actually included in the Specification. For the purposes of this definition, the method by which I \"submit\" a Contribution means any form of electronic, oral, or written communication for the purpose of discussing and improving the Specification, but excludes any such communication that I conspicuously designate in writing as not a Contribution to one or more of the Specifications developed by the Project.\n    3.  12.3. Corresponding Working Group. \"Corresponding Working Group\" is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop a Recommendation that takes the Specification as an input.\n    4.  12.4. Essential Claims. \"Essential Claims\" shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction in the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of my Contributions in an implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing the normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the state of the art at the time my Contribution is included in the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and shall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims:\n        1.  12.4.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\n        2.  12.4.2. claims which would be infringed only by:\n            -   portions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\n            -   enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification and are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\n            -   the implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\n        3.  12.4.3. design patents and design registrations.\n\n        For purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural and interoperability requirements. Optional features in the RFC 2119 sense are considered normative unless they are specifically identified as informative. Implementation examples or any other material that merely illustrate the requirements of the Specification are informative, rather than normative.\n\n    5.  12.5. I, Me, or My. \"I,\" \"me,\" or \"my\" refers to the signatory.\n    6.  12.6. Project. \"Project\" means the W3C Community Group or Business Group for which I executed this CLA.\n    7.  12.7. Specification. \"Specification\" means any specification developed by the Project, as of the date my Contribution is first included in that specification. W3C shall provide the authoritative mechanisms for the identification of Specifications created by the Project.\n    8.  12.8. W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. Subject to Section 5, with respect to my Contributions to the Specification, \"W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements\" license shall mean a non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import, and distribute and dispose of implementations of my Contributions in the Specification that:\n        1.  12.8.1. shall be available to all, worldwide, whether or not they are W3C Members;\n        2.  12.8.2. shall extend to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by me;\n        3.  12.8.3. may be limited to implementations of the Specification, and to what is required by the Specification;\n        4.  12.8.4. may be conditioned on a grant of a reciprocal RF license (as defined in this policy) to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by the licensee. A reciprocal license may be required to be available to all, and a reciprocal license may itself be conditioned on a further reciprocal license from all.\n        5.  12.8.5. may not be conditioned on payment of royalties, fees or other consideration;\n        6.  12.8.6. may be suspended with respect to any licensee when licensor issued by licensee for infringement of claims essential to implement the Specification or any W3C Recommendation;\n        7.  12.8.7. may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the use of any technology, intellectual property rights, or other restrictions on behavior of the licensee, but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to operation or maintenance of the license relationship such as the following: choice of law and dispute resolution;\n        8.  12.8.8. shall not be considered accepted by an implementer who manifests an intent not to accept the terms of the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements license as offered by the licensor.\n        9.  12.8.9. The RF license conforming to the requirements in this policy shall be made available by the licensor as long as the Specification is in effect. The term of such license shall be for the life of the patents in question.\n\n        I am encouraged to provide a contact from which licensing information can be obtained and other relevant licensing information. Any such information will be made publicly available.\n\n    9.  12.9. You or Your. \"You,\" \"you,\" or \"your\" means any person or entity who exercises copyright or patent rights granted under this CLA, and any person or entity that person or entity controls."

            "text": "# Auto-WCAG Rules repository\n\nThe Auto-WCAG Rules repository is where the Auto-WCAG community group maintains the rules they designed for (semi-)automated accessibility testing. Within the rules directory you will find all the rules recommended by the Auto-WCAG community group for implementation in automated test tools.\n\nVisit the [Auto-WCAG Rules website](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/) for the latest rules and drafts.\n\n## Related W3C Activities\n\nThe Auto-WCAG Community Group is the primary contributor of rules to the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Taskforce for the W3C. The ACT Taskforce is currently developing the standard around which rules can be created, and is planning to put together a suite of rules on how WCAG 2 (and beyond) should be tested.\n\nFor more information, see [ACT Overview - What is ACT](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Overview_-_What_is_ACT).\n\n## Write rules, not tools\n\nAn Auto-WCAG rule is a step by step description of how an accessibility test tool should run a certain conformance test for the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines][WCAG20]. The rules are written without a specific implementation in mind. The goal is not to create an accessibility test tool. Instead we aim to harmonize between existing tools, and improve their transparency and the overall quality of their results.\n\nIf you want to know more about us, visit our website at: [www.w3.org/community/auto-wcag][Auto-WCAG].\n\n## Implementing Auto-WCAG Rules\n\nAnyone developing their own accessibility testing tool is free to based this on the Auto-WCAG rules. We encourage you to document any deviations from those rules if you do so, and make these changes known to your users. Also take note that the Auto-WCAG Rules come with an aggregation algorithm describing how they all fits together, and require the tool to do some pre and post processing. All of which is described in the [test methodology](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/pages/design/rule-design.html).\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributing is open to anyone. We welcome any pull requests for changes. We ask that you make changes to pull requests **only for drafts**. Before contributing new rules, we recommend you checked their validity with several experienced accessibility auditors first. This helps you identify potential stumbling blocks early in their design.\n\nAuto-WCAG has conference calls every 4 weeks. If you are interested in becoming an active contributor or reviewer, we ask that you join the Auto-WCAG community group through the W3C Website.

This will bring you to the GitHub detail page of that file where you can start editing the file using the edit button (“pen icon”) in the top right corner, if you’re logged into Github. [Here’s an example in the Images Tutorial.][exmpImg]\n\nYou can start editing right away. We use the standard Markdown syntax. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Klick the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request”, the editor will be notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\nNote that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes in HTML that way is more technical and is described briefly in the following part of the document. But there is a preview button in the editor that gives you a fairly good example of how the rendered HTML will look like.\n\n[LivePage]:https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n[GHPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-tutorials/\n[exmpIMG]:https://github.com/w3c/wai-tutorials/blob/master/source/images/informative.html.erb.md\n"

The Report\nTool runs entirely on the client and so it can be used offline\nand in any server configuration available to you.\n\nThe Report Tool does not save files to a server or in local\nstorage. Rather, load and save functions are available for\nstoring an evaluation to your local file system.\n\nImportant references:\n\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/>\n\nThe official released version of the Report Tool can be found at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/>. An example of the latest (unapproved by EO) version is available at <http://w3c.github.io/wcag-em-report-tool/dist/>.\n\nSee [Change log](changelog.md) for details about the latest version of the WCAG-EM Report Tool.\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nBefore you can install the WCAG-EM Report Tool you will need\nto install a few components:\n\n- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/ (or [NodeJS with Node Version Manager installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))\n\n  Minimum NodeJS version \"lts/carbon\" (Long term support)\n\n- Ruby   https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/\n\n  Latest stable version\n\n\n# Install\n\nInstall the _wcag em report tool_ by running:\n\n```bash\n# Choose a root folder to install this project then:\n\n# 1\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool.git\n\n# 2\ncd wcag-em-report-tool\n\n# (Optional) if node installed with nvm\nnvm install\n\n# 3\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will fetch the project, install all node packages, bower components and compass. See `scripts: install` in `package.json` for detailed installation info.\n\n\n# Usage\nYou can launch a development version by running:\n\n    npm start\n\nTo create a build in the /dist folder run:\n\n    npm run build\n\nThe build version can be hosted in on any server that available\non http(s).

This review is part of a larger, ongoing effort to [improve these resources][ProjectPage].\n\nThe following draft documents are available in this project:\n\n* [Planning for Web Accessibility][PlanningPage]\n* [Improving the Accessibility of your Website][ImprovingPage]\n* [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility][PoliciesPage]\n\n## How to contribute\n\nEditing files works like a Wiki.\n\nBrowse to the file using the [Github Page][GHPage] and click on the \"Edit\" button of the page. This will open the Github detail page of that file where you can start editing, if you are logged in.\n\nWe use the standard [Markdown syntax][MarkdownSyntax].\n\nIf you get the following note, don't panic:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for \"Don't worry, make your edits, we will make sure they are considered!\"\"\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Click the \"Propose this change\" button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click \"Send pull request\" the editor will be notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\nNote that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes there is a \"Preview\" button.\n\n[LivePage]:http://www.w3.org/WAI/managing.html\n[ProjectPage]:https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Planning_and_Managing_Web_Accessibility\n[GHPage]:https://github.com/w3c/wai-planning-and-implementation\n[MarkdownSyntax]:http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n[PlanningPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-planning-and-implementation/Overview.html\n[ImprovingPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-planning-and-implementation/improving.html\n[PoliciesPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-planning-and-implementation/pol.html"

            "text": "# WAI Accessibility Evaluation Tools\n\n## Setup and Addition of Data\n\nData is collected in the `data` directory. There are two possibilities to use it.\n\n### (A) Local setup & GitHub Pages \n\nClone the repository to your hard disk and run\n\n~~~bash\n$ npm install\n~~~\n\nto initialize the repository and install all dependencies, like grunt. To use the data files with github pages, the files need to be compiled to one `data.js` files using the gulp script. Run\n\n~~~bash\n$ gulp watch\n~~~\n\nand add/edit the data files. The `data.json` file is automatically created.\n\n### (B) Server setup & PHP\n\nIf you want the script to pick up files on the (PHP enabled) server automatically once they are saved into the data directory, do all steps in (A) but after running `gulp watch` edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Search for `data.json` and replace it with `data.json.php`. After you save that file a new `js/master.min.js` is created that is using this path. Now you can upload the files to the server, **whenever you upload a new file to the `data` directory it will be picked up by the tool automagically**.\n\n### Appendix: Data format\n\nUsually data should be entered and edited using the submission form to ensure valid JSON. The data is collected in JSON files with each entry in the following format:\n\n~~~json\n{\n  \"title\": \"<string>\",\n  \"creator\": \"<string>\",\n  \"location\": \"<url>\",\n  \"release\": \"<date format='YYYY-MM-DD'>\",\n  \"version\": \"<string>\",\n  \"description\": \"<string>\",\n  \"language\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"guideline\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"assists\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"automated\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"repairs\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"technology\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"onlineservice\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"desktopapp\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"authoringtools\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"browsers\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"reports\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"license\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"update\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"type\": [\"<array of strings>\"]\n}\n~~~\n\n`title`, `creator`, `url`, `release`, `version` and `desc` can have only one (string) value. All other fields can either be one or multiple values. If a tool has multiple values, like different languages, enclose them with square brackets and separate them with a comma. If only one value is used, the brackets are optional. (a value of \"English\" is equivalent to [\"English\"]).\n\n Due to limitations of the tool, the values have to be the same throughout the whole data set, for example “Freeware” and “FreeWare” would be considered two different strings to filter by. This is really important for the more complex things like “WCAG 2: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2” or similar.\n \n## Listing Form Configuration\n \nThe form content can easily be edited using the `config.php` file in root. It looks like this:\n \n~~~php\n<?php\ndate_default_timezone_set('UTC'); // Sets time zone, allows us to format dates from strings.\n$demo = false; // If demo mode is true, data isn’t sent to the list.\n\n$assists = array(\n\ttitle => \"Assists evaluations by:\", // Fieldset heading\n\tdata => array( // Options, format: \"shortname_no_spaces\" => \"longname\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'Generating reports of evaluation results', \n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'Providing step-by-step evaluation guidance',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'Displaying information within web pages',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'Modifying the presentation of web pages'\n\t),\n\tother => false, // If true, a other field is displayed\n\tvariable => 'assists', // An identifier, usually the same as the variable name\n\ttype => 'checkbox', // or 'radio'\n\texplanation => array( // If items need explanations, provide it in the format \"shortname\" => \"URI\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#reports',\n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#wizards',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#in-page',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#transformation'\n\t)\n);\n\n/* multiple other of those blocks for configuration */\n~~~\n\n### Adding a new block\n\n1. Enter block data as noted above.\n\n2. In `submission.php`: \n\nAround line `100`, enter a line like the following: \n\n~~~php\n$data->assists = iter($_POST['assists'], $assists);\n~~~\n \nAround line `370`, enter a line like the following:\n  \n~~~php\n<?php create_form_cb_section($assists); ?>\n~~~\n\n### Exposing as filters\n\nTo expose a new category as filters, set the repository up for local editing and run `grunt watch` as described in (A) above. Then edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Under `var settings = {` you can find a few configuration options which are taken from the `facetedsearch.js` javascript library (see [bottom of this page for an example](https://eikes.github.io/facetedsearch/)). But there have been some changes to the configuration for facets:\n\n~~~js\nfacets: {\n\t'guideline' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Guidelines', \n\t\t'promoted': [\n\t\t\t\"<strong><abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 2.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0<\\/strong>\", \n\t\t\t\"<abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 1.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t'language'  : {\n\t\t'title': 'Languages', \n\t\t'collapsed': true\n\t},\n\t'a11yinfo' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Accessibility Statement', \n\t\t'plain': true \n\t}\n\t[…more facets…]\n},\n~~~\n\nEvery facet has a `title`, which is mandatory. It is the `<summary>` of the `<details>` element. If the facet should be collapsed by default, set `'collapsed': true`. If there should be no `<details>` & `<summary>` around that item, set `'plain': true`.\n\n"

            "text": "# WAI Dynamic Planning\n\nThis is the repository for the WAI dynamic planning resource. Developed by the\n[Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](//w3.org/WAI/EO/) with support from the [WAI-DEV project](//w3.org/WAI/DEV/), co-funded by the European Commission <abbr title=\"Information Society Technologies\">IST</abbr> Programme. \n\nYou can find the current draft state of the document on [this Github Pages site][GHPage]\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main content pages of this resource are written in Kramdown, a version of Markdown. The [Quick Reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) provides details on how to write content.\n\nEditing a page on GitHub works just like a Wiki.\n\nEither browse to the page in this repository and edit the file there, or visit the page in [Github Page][GHPage] and click on \"Fork and Edit\" at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou can start editing right away. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Click the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request” the editor of the notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\n### Helpers\n\nThe resource also provides some additional convenience helpers that are used to structure the code. These are included in the page using the following code:\n\n```\n{::nomarkdown}\n<%= activity %>\n{:/}\n```\n\nThe following elements are available:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>expand_collapse</dt>\n    <dd>Includes the markup for the expand all/collapse all controls, and adds in the markup to support expand/collapse within activities.</dd>\n\n  <dt>activity</dt>\n    <dd>Starts an activity block within a page. To end the block use <code><%= activity :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>activity_body</dt>\n    <dd>Indicates where the body of the activity begins. The body is collapsed by default and expanded when the activity head is clicked.</dd>\n\n  <dt>support</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for supporting material. To end the block use <code><%= support :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>more_information</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding additional resources that add more information to this resource. To end the block use <code><%= more_information :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>related</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding activities that are related to an activity. To end the block use <code><%= related :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>w3url</dt>\n    <dd>Creates a link to a W3C page so that when this resource is hosted on GitHub Pages, the links work as expected, but when it is deployed into w3.org, the links are all relative. Use this in combination with the <code>link_to</code> helper:</dd>\n    <dd><code><%= link_to \"WAI Homepage\", (w3url '/WAI/') %></code></dd>\n</dl>\n\n## Structure\n\nThis resource is built using [Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/), a static site generation tool. To build a local version of the resource do the following:\n\n* [Install Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/basics/install/)\n* Clone a version of this repository\n* Install the repository dependencies, `bundle install` in the repository root directory\n* Run the server, `middleman server`\n\nThis resource uses GitHub Pages to display the current draft version. If you wish to update this version from your cloned repository you need to:\n\n* Build a GitHub version of the resource\n\n    `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB=1 middleman build`\n\n* Deploy the build to GitHub\n\n    `middleman deploy`\n\nThe environment variable, `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB`, is used to configure URLs. So when the resource is deployed on GitHub Pages the URLs are absolute, and when built for production deployment in w3.org they are relative.\n\n## Deploying to live\n\nThe following steps are required in order to deploy this to the live w3.org environment. In order to deploy you will need the permissions to update content on w3.org.\n\n1. Build deployable version.\n\n    `middleman build`\n\n    This builds the content into the local `build` directory. Removing the `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB` means that the URLs in the pages built will be relative rather than absolute and that the `excol.js` scripts will be handled in a different way.\n\n2. CVS update the `/WAI/impl`, `/WAI/users`, and `/WAI/Policy` directories in your local version of the repository.\n\n3. Copy the following from the `build` directory to the local CVS `impl` directory:\n\n    * index.html\n    * acknowledgements.html\n    * implement.html\n    * initiate.html\n    * plan.html\n    * sustain.html\n    * stylesheets/*\n    * javascripts/*\n\n4. If necessary, edit the Planning & Implementing overview and make changes to the `/WAI/managing.html` page.\n\n5. If necessary, edit the following pages and update the navigation to change the label and URL for this resource:\n\n    * /WAI/managing.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/harmon.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/Overview.html\n    * /WAI/impl/pol.html\n    * /WAI/impl/improving.html\n    * /WAI/users/involving.html\n    * /WAI/impl/software.html\n\n6. Commit all the changes to the w3.org CVS repository.\n\n7. Check all the pages to find the typo that you accidentally left in.\n\n[GHPage]: https://w3c.github.io/wai-dynamic-planning/"

I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.\n\nMy ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:\n\n* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.\n* A helpful 404 template.\n* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.\n* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.\n* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.\n* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.\n* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.\n* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.\n* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nIf you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your `_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the \"Generate\" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.\n\nIf you want to set things up manually, download `_s` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `_s` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.\n\n1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.\n2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.\n3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in style.css.\n4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.\n5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.\n\nOR\n\n* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`\n* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `megatherium_`\n* Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.\n* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>\n* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `megatherium-`\n\nThen, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.\n\nNow you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)\n\nGood luck!\n"

            "text": "# wai-statements\n\nAccessibility Statement generator tool pages are a part of the WAI website and therefore makes use of the [wai-website-theme](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website-theme) as dependency. Both make use of [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create the pages.\n\n- Github page: https://w3c.github.io/wai-statements/planning/statements/\n\n- [Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Accessibility_Statements_Requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Installation and local development\n\n### Installation as part of the WAI website\n\nThis site is build with Jekyll, [follow Jekyll's installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) first.\n\nThen clone this repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/wai-statements.git\n```\n\nIf you have installed ruby and jekyll, cd into the project and install dependencies defined inside the `Gemfile`:\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nNow you can start development with:\n\n```\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\n\n### Installation as stand-alone\n\nTo use the accessibility statement generator tool as a stand-alone to include into your own site you need to build the site once with Jekyll, see \"[Installation as part of the WAI website](#installation-as-part-of-the-wai-website)\".\n\nBuild the site:\n```\nbundle exec jekyll build\n```\n\nThe complete site is build inside the `_site` folder and the generated files you need will be:\n\n- HTML: `planning/statements/generator/index.html`\n\n    You will need all contents of `<div id=\"accstatement\">` and link to required css and javascript below. The rest is all WAI website material.\n\n- CSS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.css`\n- JS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.js`\n- WAI theme assets: `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/scripts/main.js`\n\n    This is required for the expanding and toggling of sections and information.\n\nFor now you need to strip and modify all files manually to make it includeable into your own project.\n\n#### TODO for stand alone version\n\n- [ ] Add standalone version page `generator/standalone.html`\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Customizing the generator tool\n\n### Add, remove and update content\n\nThe generator tool is setup in such a way that content is seperated from function. In this way, adding and removing form or preview content is easy to do. Addition is only required inside the `generator.html` file.\n\n#### Editing the statement create form\n\nThe create statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page create\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nThere is one extra functionality available to dynamically add extra line to grouped form input; add-line. To use this there are several practical examples inside the form. Required for add-line to work is this basic setup:\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"group\">\n    <legend>An add-line input group</legend>\n\n    <!--\n        OPTIONAL: Pre defined lines\n        class line is optional and will determine the count start\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field line\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_1\">Some addline item 1</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_1\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: A prototype declared\n        class proto required\n        [n] = placeholder for the line count\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field proto\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_[n]\">Some addline item [n]</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_[n]\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: An add-line button\n        To add the proto to the fieldset as line\n    -->\n    <button type=\"button\" class=\"add-line\">\n        Add another line\n    </button>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n#### Editing the statement preview\n\nThe preview statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nSame as with [editing the statement create form](#editing-the-statement-create-form), just add or remove html markup to edit the statement preview.\n\nTo print the form data into the statement preview there is some additional functionality available:\n\n- Printing formdata with `data-print` attribute:\n\n    Example print usage:\n    ```html\n    <!--\n        Single input data\n        data-print          REQUIRED    input id to print\n        data-printdefault   OPTIONAL    defaultvalue if data is missing or empty\n        data-printfilter    OPTIONAL    Output transformation; one of [lowercase, capitalize]\n    -->\n    <span data-print=\"forminput_id\" data-printdefault=\"MY_FORM_DATA\" data-printfilter=\"lowercase, capitalize\"></span>\n\n    <!--\n        Print as url\n        The data entered will also be outputted into the href\n        and can be prefixed like “mailto:” for example.\n    -->\n    <a href=\"URL_PREFIX\" data-print=\"some_url_data\"></a>\n\n    <!--\n        Print Grouped data:\n        UL or OL\n        Grouped data is stored under the group name\n        defined as name on input elements\n        Filters added are applied for each data item inside the group\n    -->\n    <ul data-print=\"some_grouped_data\"></ul>\n    ```\n\n- Conditionally show sections with `data-if` attribute:\n\n    To make the statement preview show sections based on filled form inputs / groups, you can wrap contents with a conditional element and / or include a condition to an element like:\n\n    ```html\n    <!-- Wrapped inside condition -->\n    <div data-if=\"required_data_id\">\n        <!-- Content will be visible based on available data -->\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Or part of section -->\n    <div>\n        <!-- Other content … -->\n        <p data-if=\"some_data\">\n            This text will be shown if some_data is present.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Depending on multiple data sources -->\n    <div data-if=\"this_data, that_data\">\n        <!-- Stays hidden until one of data sources is present -->\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nCurrently custom handled statement parts are:\n\n- Conformance meaning data (Updates to hidden input #accstmnt_conformance_meaning)\n- Limitations section (Still reading directly from DOM)\n\nWhen changes are required here edits on generator.js are necessary.\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nCurrently this application does not support easy translation. For now you need to duplicate the `generator.html` file and rename both something like `generator_en.html` and `generator_fr.html`. Then just edit the contents manually.\n\nContents for the create page (form) are wrapped in `<section class=\"page create\">`, preview inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`.\n"

Please make branch names informative - by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the specification or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nAll pull requests must have been reviewed by one or more participants of the working groups. Once the pull request gets enough support, it can be merged.\n\n### Test driven\n\nALL normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in [web-platforms-tests][WPT], either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.\n\nTypically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull\nrequest for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the '[needs tests](https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html)'\nlabel or, in web-platform-tests, the '[status:needs-spec-decision](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20)' label. Note that a test change that\ncontradicts the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.\n\nIf testing is not practical due to [web-platforms-tests][WPT] limitations, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) with the '[type:untestable](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20)' label to follow up later.\n\nSee also the [web-platform-tests documentation][WPT-intro].\n\n## Patent Policy and Licensing\n\nContributions to the Web Performance repositories are intended to become part of Recommendation-track\ndocuments governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

The user agent is in a better position to determine when background tasks can be run without introducing user-perceptible delays or jank in animations and input response, based on its knowledge of currently scheduled tasks, vsync deadlines, user-interaction and so on. Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate scheduling of background tasks during times when the browser would otherwise be idle.\n\nLatest draft: https://w3c.github.io/requestidlecallback/\n\nSee also [Web performance README](https://github.com/w3c/web-performance/blob/gh-pages/README.md)\n"

            "text": "# Long Task API\n\nLong Tasks is a new real user measurement (RUM) performance API to enable applications to measure responsiveness. It enables detecting presence of “long tasks” that monopolize the UI thread for extended periods of time and block other critical tasks from being executed - e.g. reacting to user input.\n\n## Background\nAs the page is loading and while the user is interacting with the page afterwards, both the application and browser queue various events that are then executed by the browser -- e.g. the user agent schedules input events based on user’s activity, the application schedules callbacks for requestAnimationFrame and other callbacks etc. Once in the queue, these events are then dequeued one-by-one by the browser and executed — see [“the anatomy of a frame”](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame) for a high-level overview of this process in Blink.\n\nHowever, some tasks can take a long time (multiple frames), and if and when that happens, the UI thread is locked and all other tasks are blocked as well. To the user this is commonly visible as a “locked up” page where the browser is unable to respond to user input; this is a major source of bad user experience on the web today:\n\n* _Delayed [“time to Interactive”](https://github.com/tdresser/time-to-interactive)_:  while the page is loading long tasks often tie up the main thread and prevent the user from interacting with the page even though the page is visually rendered. Poorly designed third-party content is a frequent culprit.\n* _High/variable input latency_: critical user interaction events (tap, click, scroll, wheel, etc) are queued behind long tasks, which yields janky and unpredictable user experience.\n* _High/variable event handling latency_: similar to input, but for processing event callbacks (e.g. onload events, and so on), which delay application updates.\n* _Janky animations and scrolling_: some animation and scrolling interactions require coordination between compositor and main threads; if the main thread is blocked due to a long task, it can affect responsiveness of animations and scrolling.\n\nSome applications (and RUM vendors) are already attempting to identify and track cases where “long tasks” happen. For example, one known pattern is to install a ~short periodic timer and inspect the elapsed time between the successive calls: if the elapsed time is greater than the timer period, then there is high likelihood that one or more long tasks have delayed execution of the timer. This mostly works, but it has several bad performance implications: the application is polling to detect long tasks, which prevents quiescence and long idle blocks (see requestIdleCallback); it’s bad for battery life; and there is no way to know what caused the delay. (e.g. first party vs third party code)\n\n[RAIL performance model](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/rail?hl=en#response-respond-in-under-100ms) suggests that applications should respond in under 100ms to user input; for touch move and scrolling in under 16ms. Our goal with this API is to surface notifications about tasks that may prevent the application from hitting these targets.\n\n## Terminology\nMajor terms:\n* **frame** or **frame context** refers to the browsing context, such as iframe (not animation frame), embed or object\n* **culprit frame** refers to the frame or container (iframe, object, embed etc) that is being implicated for the long task\n* **attribution** refers to identifying the type of work (such as script, layout etc.) that contributed significantly to the long task AND which browsing context or frame is responsible for that work.\n* **minimal frame attribution** refers to the browsing context or frame that is being implicated overall for the long task\n\n## V1 API\nLong Task API introduces a new PerformanceEntry object, which will report instances of long tasks:\n```javascript\ninterface PerformanceLongTaskTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  [SameObject, SaveSameObject] readonly attribute FrozenArray<TaskAttributionTiming> attribution;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of PerformanceLongTaskTiming:\n* entryType: \"longtask\"\n* startTime: `DOMHighResTimeStamp` of when long task started\n* duration: elapsed time (as `DOMHighResTimeStamp`) between start and finish of task\n* name: minimal frame attribution, eg. \"same-origin\", \"cross-origin\", \"unknown\" etc. Possible values are:\n * \"self\"\n * \"same-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"same-origin-descendant\"\n * \"same-origin\"\n * \"cross-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"cross-origin-descendant\"\n * \"cross-origin-unreachable\"\n * \"multiple-contexts\"\n * \"unknown\"\n\n* attribution: `sequence` of `TaskAttributionTiming`, a new `PerformanceEntry` object to report attribution within long tasks. To see how `attribute` is populated for different values of `name` see the section below: [Pointing to the culprit](#pointing-to-the-culprit)\n\n```javascript\ninterface TaskAttributionTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerType;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerSrc;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerId;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerName;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of TaskAttributionTiming:\n* entryType: “taskattribution”\n* startTime: 0\n* duration: 0\n* name: type of attribution, eg. \"script\" or \"layout\"\n* containerType: type of container for culprit frame eg. \"iframe\" (most common), \"embed\", \"object\".\n* containerName: `DOMString`, container’s name attribute\n* containerId: `DOMString`, container’s id attribute\n* containerSrc: `DOMString`, container’s src attribute\n\n\nLong tasks events will be delivered to all observers (in frames within the page or tab) regardless of which frame was responsible for the long task. The goal is to allow all pages on the web to know if and who (first party content or third party content) is causing disruptions. \n\nThe `name` field provides minimal frame attribution so that the observing frame can respond to the issue in the proper way. In addition, the `attribution` field provides further insight into the type of work (script, layout etc) that caused the long task as well as which frame is responsible for that work. For more details on how the `attribution` is set, see the \"Pointing to the culprit\" section.\n\nThe above covers existing use cases found in the wild, enables document-level attribution, and eliminates the negative performance implications mentioned earlier. To receive these notifications, the application can subscribe to them via PerformanceObserver interface:\n\n```javascript\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process long task notifications:\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n\n// register observer for long task notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"longtask\"]});\n\n// Long script execution after this will result in queueing \n// and receiving “longtask” entries in the observer.\n```\n\n**Long-task threshold is 50ms.** That is, the UA should emit long-task events whenever it detects tasks whose execution time exceeds >50ms. \n\n### Demo\nFor a quick demo of a partial implementation, in the latest Chrome Canary (version 55.0.2867.0 or up) go to [chrome://flags](chrome://flags) and enable the flag: \"Experimental Web Platform features\".\nThen visit this link:\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/render-jank-demo.html\n\nFor a demo of long tasks from same-origin & cross-origin frames see the demo below. Interacting with the iframed wikipedia page will generate cross-origin long task notifications.\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/demo.html\n\n\n### Pointing to the culprit\nLong task represents the top level event loop task. Within this task, different types of work (such as script, layout, style etc) may be done, and they could be executed within different frame contexts. The type of work could also be global in nature such as a long GC that is process or frame-tree wide.\n\nThus pointing to the culprit has couple of facets:\n* Pointing to the overall frame to blame for the long task on the whole: this is refered to as \"minimal frame attribution\" and is captured in the `name` field\n* Pointing to the type of work involved in the task, and its associated frame context: this is captured in `TaskAttributionTiming` objects in the `attribution` field of `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` \n\nTherefore, `name` and `attribution` fields on PerformanceLongTaskTiming together paint the picture for where the blame rests for a long task.\n\nThe security model of the web means that sometimes a long task will happen in an iframe that is unreachable from the observing frame. For instance, a long task might happen in a deeply nested iframe that is different from my origin. Or similarly, I might be an iframe doubly embedded in a document, and a long task will happen in the top-level browsing context. In the web security model, I can know from which direction the issue came, one of my ancestors or descendants, but to preserve the frame origin model, we must be careful about pointing to the specific container or frame.\n\nCurrently the TaskAttributionTiming entry in `attribution` is populated with \"script\" work (in the future layout, style etc will be added). The container or frame implicated in `attribution` should match up with the `name` as follows:\n\n| value of `name`         | frame implicated in `attribution`| \n| ----------------------- |:-------------------------:| \n| self                    | empty                     | \n| same-origin-ancestor    | same-origin culprit frame |\n| same-origin-descendant  | same-origin culprit frame | \n| same-origin             | same-origin culprit frame | \n| cross-origin-ancestor   | empty                     |\n| cross-origin-descendant | first cross-origin child frame between my own frame and culprit frame|\n| cross-origin-unreachable| empty                     |\n| multiple-contexts       | empty                     |\n| unknown                 | empty                     |\n\n\n## Privacy & Security\nLong Tasks API surfaces long tasks greater than a threshold (50ms) to developers via Javascript (Performance Observer API). It includes origin-safe attribution information about the source of the long task.\nThere is a 50ms threshold for long tasks. Together this provides adequate protection against security attacks against browser.\n\nHowever, privacy related attacks are possible, while the API doesn’t introduce any new privacy attacks, it could expedite existing privacy attacks. If this were to become an concern, additional mitigations can be implemented to address this such as dropping \"culprit\" after a per-target origin threshold is exceeded, or limiting to 10 origins per minute etc.\n\nDetailed Security & Privacy doc is here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIMI1gau_q6X5EBnjDNiFS5NWV9cpYJ5KKA7xPd3VB8/edit#\n\n## V2 API Sketch\nSee: https://docs.google.com/document/d/125d69JAC7nyx-Ob0a9Z31d1uHUGu4myYQ3os9EnGfdU/edit\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n### Why not just show sub-tasks vs. top-level tasks with attribution?\nThis API will show toplevel long tasks along with attribution for specific sub-tasks which were problematic.\nFor instance, within a 50ms toplevel task, sub-tasks such as a 20ms script execution or a 30ms style & layout update -- will be attributed.\nThis raises the question -- why show the toplevel task at all? Why not only show long sub-tasks such as script, style & layout etc that are directly actionable by the user? The top level task may contain some un-attributable segments such as browser work eg. GC or browser events etc.\n\nThe rationale here is that showing the toplevel task is good for web developers, even though they will actively consume the actionable sub-tasks such as long scripts and act on them. Over time the sub-task attribution will keep expanding, making more of the long task actionable.\nShowing the top-level task gives developers a direct indication of main thread busy-ness, and since this directly impacts the user experience, it is appropriate for them to know about it as a problem signal -- even if they cannot have complete visibility or full actionability for the entire length of the long task. \nIn many cases the developers may be able to repro in lab or locally and glean additional insights and get to the root cause. \nLong tasks provide context to long sub-tasks, for instance, a 20ms style and layout or a 25ms script execution may not be terrible by themselves, but if they happen consecutively (eg. script started from rAF) and cause a long 50ms task, then this is a problem for user responsiveness.\n\n"

            "text": "# PerformancePaintTiming\n\nWeb developers require more information on page load performance in the wild. \nNo single moment in time completely captures the \"loading experience\". To give developers insight into the loading experience, we propose a set of key progress metrics to capture the series of key moments during pageload which developers care about.\n\nFor detailed motivation, see the [Why First Paint?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdxSXo_jctZjdPaJeTtYYFF-rLtUFxrU72_7h9qbQaM/edit) doc.\n\nFirst Paint (FP), is the first of these key moments, followed by First Contentful Paint (FCP). In the future, we may add additional metrics, such as First Meaningful Paint (FMP), and Time to Interactive (TTI).\n\n## Interface\nWe propose introducing the `PerformancePaintTiming` interface, extending the PerformanceEntry interface, to report the time to first paint and time to first contentful paint.\n\n```javascript\ninterface PerformancePaintTiming : PerformanceEntry {};\n```\n\nEntries will have a `name` of \"first-paint\" and \"first-contentful-paint\" respectively, and an `entryType` of `\"paint\"`. `startTime` is the `DOMHighResTimeStamp` indicating when the paint occurred, and the `duration` will always be 0.\n\n## Definition\n\n- `\"first-paint\"` entries contain a `DOMHighResTimeStamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the browser has started to render the page.\n\n- `\"first-contentful-paint\"` contain a `DOMHighResTimestamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.\n\n_WIP: [define processing algorithm and integration with HTML](https://github.com/w3c/paint-timing/issues/4)_\n\n---\n\nThe browser has performed a \"paint\" or \"render\" when it has converted the render tree to pixels on the screen. \n\nMore formally, we consider the browser to have \"rendered\" a document when it has updated \"the rendering or user interface of that Document and its browsing context to reflect the current state\". See the HTML spec's section on the event loop processing model – [section 7.12](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model).\n\nThe rendering pipeline is very complex, and the timestamp should be the latest timestamp the browser is able to note in this pipeline (best effort). Typically the time at which the frame is submitted to the OS for display is recommended for this API.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\n\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process entries\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n// register observer for paint timing notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"paint\"]});\n\n```\nThese entries will be buffered for the cases where PerformanceObserver is unable to register itself early enough on the page. \nFor this case paint entries can be accessed as follows:\n```javascript\n\nperformance.getEntriesByType('paint');\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples are hand annotated, based on the definitions given above.\n\n![Web page filmstrips with annotated first paint times.](filmstrip.png)\n\nSome rough bulk data can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0-tOtZP21m3DjBJflUJYao9-WAKwWV2p9WFlVhVivg/edit#gid=1447332636) or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGauGA3EvN8NBC3ErWjLd8Bz-NzmmEa6q6UP5KhfgeA/edit#gid=0). This data was collected using a somewhat different definition than we're currently using – it includes white paints in `first-paint` and only looks at text and image paints for `first-contentful-paint`.\n\n#### Why not add this to Navigation Timing?\nThis belongs outside Navigation Timing because Navigation Timing is spec'd as queueing the entry on document load end; however, FCP (or FMP in the future) may not have triggered at that point.\n"

            "text": "# Device Memory\n\n## Motivation & Use cases\nA “one-size-fits-all” web experience does not work in a world with widely varying device capabilities. Web apps that delight users on high end devices can be unusable on low end devices, particularly in emerging markets.\nTo support a diverse web ecosystem that is inclusive of users on low end devices, apps need to be able to tailor their content to the device constraints. This allows users to consume content suited to their device, and ensures they have a good experience and fewer frustrations.\n\nDevelopers are interested in the “device class” for the following known use-cases:\n1. Serve a “lite” version of the site or specific components, for low end devices. Egs:\n- Google’s \"search lite\" is a 10KB search results page used in EM. \n- Serve a \"lite\" version of video player in Facebook\n- Serve lightweight tile images in Google Maps\n2. Normalize Metrics: analytics need to be able to normalize their metrics against the device-class. \nFor instance, a 100ms long task is a more severe issue on a Pixel vs. on a low end device.\n\nDevice memory is an interesting signal in this context. Low memory devices devices (under 512MB, 512MB-1GB) are widely used in emerging markets. Chrome telemetry indicates a large number of OOM (out-of-memory) crashes on foreground tabs on these devices. In this case, serving a lite version not only improves the user experience, it is necessary for the site to be usable at all (as opposed to crashing due to memory constraints).\n\n## Proposal\nWe propose a new HTTP Client Hints header and a web exposed API to surface device capabilities for memory (RAM). The mechanism should be extensible to other device capabilities such as CPU i.e. number of cores, clock speed etc.\nA Client Hints header will enable the server to deliver appropriate content, eg. a “lite” version of the site.\nThe JS API will be a convenience for analytics reporting and may be used to make runtime decisions eg. using more storage vs. making additional requests, requesting appropriate resources from the server etc.\n\nASIDE: the JS API for CPU Cores is already available via hardwareConcurrency API\n\n### The Header\nProposed Client Hints Header for memory: `Device-Memory`\\\n`Device-Memory : <value>`\\\nwhere `<value>` is an approximation of the amount of RAM in GiB (floating point number).\\\nThe `<value>` is calculated by using the actual device memory in MiB then rounding it to the nearest number where only the most significant bit can be set and the rest are zeros (nearest power of two). Then dividing that number by 1024.0 to get the value in GiB.\n\nAn upper bound and a lower bound should be set on the list of values. While implementations may choose different values, the recommended upper bound is 8GiB and the recommended lower bound is 0.25GiB (or 256MiB).\nThe upper and lower bounds are not explicit, as they are subject to change over time.\n\nThe following table illustrates some examples:\n\n| Actual in MiB | Rounded in MiB | Reported in GiB |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 500           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 512           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 768           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 1000          | 1024           | 1               |\n| 1793          | 2048           | 2               |\n\nA full list of possible values is as follows:\n0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8\n\n#### Why separate header and rounding?\nHTTP caching doesn't deal well with mixed value headers, therefore separate headers are recommended. Also, rounding down to power of two enables caching and mitigates fingerprinting.\n\n#### When is the header sent?\nClient Hints cannot be used to enable providing network performance data on the first request, however this is being actively addressed with [this proposal](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512).\nThe header is sent after an explicit per-origin opt-in via Client Hints mechanism. The following new hint will be added: `Accept-CH: Device-Memory`\n\nFor background, [Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html) provides a set of HTTP request header fields, known as Client Hints, to deliver content that is optimized for the device. In that sense using Client Hints is a great fit for this proposal.\nClient Hints recently addressed a [significant limitation in spec](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512): opt-in can now be persisted across browser restarts using `max-age` in header.\n\n#### Usage Guidance\nServers can advertise support for Client Hints using the Accept-CH header field or an equivalent HTML meta element with http-equiv attribute\n```\n  Accept-CH = Device-Memory\n```\n\nThe Memory request header field is a number for the client’s device memory i.e. approximate amount of ram in GiB.\neg. 512 MiB will be reported as:\n```\n  Device-Memory: 0.5\n```\n\nServers can use this header to customize content for low memory device eg. serve light version of the app or a component such as a video player.\n\nNOTE: This header will not be immediately available in all browser. Do not assume presence of the header, and provide a graceful fallback for browsers that don't support the header.\n\n### The web exposed API\nWe propose adding the following API to navigator: `navigator.deviceMemory`\nwhich returns number of GiB of ram (floating point number) rounded down to the nearest power of two (same as the header).\n\n## Why not surface Device Class directly?\nWhile exposing a composite “Device Class” would be useful for developers, it has a number of challenges: it’s hard to specify in a future-proof manner as it is constantly changing, it requires significant and ongoing work (constantly update algorithm OR classify known devices), it is difficult to reach agreement amongst vendors, and come up with something that works for all web sites etc.\nWhile this is something worth considering down the road, we think we can get most of the benefit by exposing a couple of specific signals device memory and device CPU cores. In particular device memory is a reasonable proxy for device class.\n\n## Security & Privacy\nThe client hint header and API will only be available on HTTPS secure connections.\n\nSee [Security section in Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html#security-considerations).\nRequiring per-origin opt-in with Accept-CH restricts when the header is advertised.\nTo reduce fingerprinting risk, reported value is rounded to single most significant bit, as opposed to reporting the exact value. In addition, an upper and lower bound is placed on the reported values.\n\nNOTE: Device identification is already possible and rampant today, based on UA string.

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n"

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

Optional enable it with `LINEWRAP=true`\n* [respec](https://github.com/w3c/respec) validity\n* [WebIDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/) validity using [widlproc](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/widlproc)\n* HTML5 validity of the generated file using [html5validator/Nu Html Checker](https://github.com/validator/validator)\n* Check internal links using [linkchecker](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/linkchecker)\n\n`tidy` - Cleanup your document markup using [tidy-html5](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Local use\n\nExample usage on the [Media Capture and Streams specification](https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/)\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:w3c/mediacapture-main.git\ncd mediacapture-main\nmake setup\nmake check\n```\n\nThe `mediacapture-main/Makefile` script will take care of installing and setting up `webrtc-respec-ci` and its dependencies automatically.\n\n### With Travis\n\nExample `.travis.yml` file using [Travis CI's Container-based infrastructure](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#Virtualization-environments).\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: python\n\ndist: trusty\n\nbranches:\n  only:\n    - /.*/\n\nsudo: false\n\naddons:\n  apt:\n    packages:\n      - libwww-perl\n      - libcss-dom-perl\n  chrome: stable\n\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - node_modules # NPM packages\n\nbefore_install:\n  - nvm install lts/*\n\ninstall:\n - make travissetup\n\nscript:\n - make check\n```\n\n### Line wrapping\n\nThis script can help you ensure that your modifications do not break line wrapping of the original document.\n\nCheck line wrapping _(using default line length of 100 characters defined in webrtc-respec-ci/tidy.config)_:\n```bash\nLINEWRAP=true make tidycheck\n```\n\nYou can define a specific line length for your document by editing `tidy.config` and setting the `wrap` option to the desired line length eg `wrap: 80`.\n"

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

In particular, developers wish to take reasonable steps to protect\nusers from local attackers by ensuring that certain kinds of data are removed from a user's local\nmachine when it is no longer necessary (for example, upon signing out of an application, or upon\naccount deletion).\n\nDevelopers have direct access to a number of storage mechanisms, which makes it possible to perform\nthis kind of cleanup from JavaScript. `window.localStorage`, for example, is easily dealt with a\nsimple call to `window.localStorage.clear()`. Other storage mechanisms are trickier. Cookies, for\ninstance, exist cross-origin, might not be accessible to JavaScript, and could have path\nrestrictions that can make them quite difficult to enumerate. The browser's various caches are even\nmore difficult to poke at, as they're intentionally opaque.\n\nIt would be nice if browsers offered developers a mechanism that would give them power to remove the\ndata their applications are responsible for maintaining. Ideally, developers should be able to\nreliably ensure the following:\n\n1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like IndexedDB, WebSQL, Filesystem,\n    `self.localStorage`, `self.sessionStorage`, `self.caches`, etc. is cleared.\n2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed.\n3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.\n4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.\n5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.\n6.  None of the above can be bypassed by a maliciously active document that\n    retains interesting data in memory, and rewrites it if it's cleared.\n\n## The Proposal\n\nOne way to give developers the capabilities alluded to above would be to accept a server-sent\nassertion that an origin's data be cleared. This could be an HTTP response header whose value\nspecified a subset of locally stored data to be cleared:\nof:\n\n```\nClear-Site-Data: \"*\"\n```\n\nWith this kind of assertion, developers could handle a number of use cases:\n\n1.  When a user deletes their account from a given social media application, the \"Oh noes, you're\n    gone!\" page could be served along with `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"` to clear out any and all sensitive\n    information that may have been persisted to the user's disk.\n\n2.  If a user signs out of a given application, it might do a more targeted cleanup, removing, for\n    example, photos from the disk cache, while retaining cookies with interesting user preferences\n    by serving `Clear-Site-Data: \"cache\"`.\n\n3.  In the case of catastrophic failure (perhaps an applications developers learn that their servers\n    were compromised for some period of time), developers can reduce the risk of a persistent\n    client-side XSS by clearing out local sources of data: `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"`.\n"

It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write tests\nthat automate a user agent from a separate controlling process, but\nmay also be used in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to\ncontrol a — possibly separate — browser.\n\nThe standard is authored by the W3C [Browser Testing- and Tools\nWorking Group], and has produced the following documents:\n\n  * **Living Document**: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/\n  * **Candidate Recommendation** level 1: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/\n\n[Browser Testing- and Tools Working Group]: https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIn short, change `index.html` and submit a pull request\n(PR) with a [good commit message].  Changes that affect behaviour\n_must_ be accompanied with corresponding test changes to the [Web\nPlatform Tests] repository.\n\nWe use [ReSpec] to help us maintain referential integrity,\nbibliographical data, and perform other mundane tasks such as\nstyling.  To preview your changes, just load `index.html` from disk\nin a browser.  To verify the integrity of the document you can run\n`make test`.\n\nFor more information about the interoperability of driver\nimplementations, see the [implementation report].\n\nYou may add your name to the [Acknowledgements] section in your\nfirst PR, even for trivial fixes.

For this initial specification, we believe that a simplified subset API will accelerate implementation, interoperability testing, standardization and ultimately developer adoption. This JavaScript Speech API will enable web developers to incorporate scripts into their web pages that can generate text-to-speech output and can use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control. Specification of HTML markup and a network speech protocol are out-of-scope of this Community Group.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/XGR-htmlspeech/\r\n[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2011OctDec/att-1696/speechapi.html",

This is currently hard :-(\n\n# Implementation status:\n- EdgeHTML: [Shipped](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/pointerevents)\n- Blink: [Shipped](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4504699138998272)\n- Suggested polyfill: [jQuery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP)\n- Gecko: [In development](https://platform-status.mozilla.org/#pointer-events) (though enabled on desktop in Firefox 59)\n- WebKit: [Opposition](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2012-December/023050.html)\n"

It contains the [Touch Events Level 2](http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/) editors draft (which contains all the changes from an old v1-errata branch and the [Touch Events Extension Working Group Note](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions/)).\n2. v1 - this branch is it not active. (It was the working branch for the v1 specification.)\n\n# Process for Landing Changes\n\nPer the group's [2015-Jan-27 agreement](http://www.w3.org/2015/01/27-touchevents-minutes.html#item05), the following process is used to review and approve Pull Requests:\n\n* Submit a pull request and post the PR's link to the [public-touchevents](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-touchevents/) e-mail list asking for feedback.\n* As soon as one of the listed spec editors approves the PR it can be merged.\n* If there's debate over a PR that has already landed, it may be reverted until consensus is reached.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding\n[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,\nboth PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should\nnot be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why\nand if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow\nup later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It will exist to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Tibetan script on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Tibetan Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/tlreq/)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-tibetan](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-tibetan/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the traditional Tibetan writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-mongolian.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=tibetan) page. (That link applies an `tibetan` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings.

Please provide comments on ITS 2.0 and the test suite on the ITS Interest Group mailing list http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-its-ig/\n\nFurther information about the test suite is available in [test-suite-howto.html](its2.0/test-suite-howto.html) (also avail. as [PDF](its2.0/test-suite-howto.pdf)) in this directory and in the [nif-conversion](its2.0/nif-conversion) subdirectory.\n\nLicensing Information\n=================\n\nThe following files are available under the W3C Test Suite License http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-license.html\n\n* Input files, expected output files and implementers output files in the directories inputdata, expected and outputimplementers under https://github.com/finnle/ITS-2.0-Testsuite/tree/master/its2.0/\n\nValidating Input Test Files\n=================\nValidating XML test files\n-------------------------\n\n* Download and install Ant from http://ant.apache.org/\n\n* Run 'ant validate-xml' command in its2.0 directory\n\nValidating HTML test files\n--------------------------\n\n* Download and install Ant from http://ant.apache.org/\n\n* Download html5-its-tools from https://github.com/kosek/html5-its-tools\n\n* Modify its2.0/build.properties to point to your local copy of html5-its-tools\n\n* Run 'ant validate-html' command in its2.0 directory\n\nValidating all test files\n-------------------------\n\n* Make sure that XML and HTML validation described above works for you\n\n* Run 'ant' command in its2.0 directory\n\n* Please note that HTML schema doesn't supports RDFa so RDFa attributes are reported as errors\n\n* Please note that currently Schematron validation is not performed so some errors are not detected\n \nValidating Output Test Files\n=================\nTo validate test suite output files simply compile the test suite dashboard (this will only work if you have java installed and saxon downloaded):\n\n* Download saxon.jar from here: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\n* Then use this command (Linux/Mac/Windows): \n  java -jar /path/of/file/saxon.jar  testsuiteMaster.xml  testsuiteDashboard.xsl -o:testSuiteDashboard.html\n* Upload newly compiled testsuiteDashboard.html to the git hub\n* Check the state of your files in the related data categories on this web page:\n  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/w3c/its-2.0-testsuite/blob/master/its2.0/testSuiteDashboard.html\n\nExplanations of states :\n* N/A = the implementer did not commit to run the test.\n* OK = the output file is identical to the reference output file.\n* error = an error occurred, e.g. the output file is not available or it is not identical to the reference output file. Move the mouse over error to see details.\n* fnf: the output file from the implementer has not been found.\n\nValidating NIF output files\n---------------------------\nNote: The conversion to NIF is not a normative part of the ITS 2.0 specification.\nPrerequisites: Java and Unix Shell\n* create a temporary folder for output files (hence called $datafolder)\n* read ITS files from \"its2.0/nif-conversion/input/\" one by one, convert to NIF and write output files in turtle to $datafolder\n* go to directory \n  cd its2.0/nif-conversion/sparqltest\n* run :\n  ./executeTests.sh ../relative/pathTo/$datafolder\n  \nExplanations of output:\n* If no message appears between \"Running: test1.sparql\" and \"Done: test1.sparql\" the test was successfull. \n* Otherwise the output filename and additional debug output is shown.\n"

We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect. As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a shared understanding of the Web of Things, and to identify opportunities for initiating standards track work within W3C working groups. Liaisons between W3C, industry alliances and standards development organizations are already in discussion for two critical areas: semantic interoperability and end-to-end security across different platforms.",

Instead, go to https://github.com/w3c/wot, where GitHub will have found your new branch and will offer to open a pull-request (base fork: `w3c/wot`, base: `master` ... head fork: `{your-account}/wot`, compare: `{your-branch}`).\n* If you have a separate change proposal for the same file, go back to your master branch and repeat the process from clicking the edit icon.\n* If the pull-request discussion expects you to update your change proposal, go to your branch corresponding to the PR, click the edit icon, and commit directly to that branch.\n\n### Command-line based Pull-Request\n\n* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c/wot#fork-destination-box) the `w3c/wot` repository into your own account\n* Create a branch in your fork for one particular topic (e.g., a single IG scope item) with a proper name (e.g., `charter-ig-scope-plugfest`)\n* Make your edits and commit\n* Push the new branch to your own repository fork\n* GitHub will automatically offer to open a pull-request to `w3c/wot` (from your new branch to master)\n\n### Github Help\n\n* https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ provides a tutorial on GitHub pull-requests.\n* If you have not worked with GitHub in this way before, we will give direct assistance.\n"

Checkout the code\n 2. Run \"mvn clean compile\" to auto generate binding files\n 3. Open with IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ)\n\n## Directory Layout\n\n * bin: executables\n * data: example data to work with (to help validating and discussing the ontologies)\n * generated: auto generated files based (e.g. documentation, graphical representation, other serializations)\n * import: related ontologies to be reused (second main focus)\n * ontologies: upper ontologies (to main focus)\n * queries: example queries to work with (to help validating and discussing the ontologies)\n * src: omnlib (Java implementation and tests)\n\n## Suggested Tools\n\n * [sparql](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/tools/) (command line tool from jena to query data)\n * [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu) (graphical ontology editor)\n * [Eclipse Xturtle](http://aksw.org/Projects/Xturtle.html) (text based ontology editor with code completion and simple validation)\n * [rdf.sh](https://github.com/seebi/rdf.sh) (command line ontology tools)\n * [OwlToUml](https://github.com/twalcari/OwlToUml) (to visualize simple ontologies as plantuml diagrams)\n * [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) (command line tool to convert and check ontologies)\n * [lodlive](http://en.lodlive.it) (user friendly vizualization of a sparql endpoint)\n * [yasgui](http://yasgui.laurensrietveld.nl) (user friendly query of a sparql endpoint)\n * [LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode) (documentation generator for OWL files)\n\n## How To (rather old approach)\n\n### Run example Queries\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh\n\n### Example (pre defined): Get the published nodes\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh example2\n\n### Example (arbitrary): Get the status of the nodes for FLS\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh advertisement-fp getnodestatus\n"

WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of [common hardware capabilities](Portability.md#assumptions-for-efficient-execution) available on a wide range of platforms.\n\n- **WebAssembly is safe**: WebAssembly describes a [memory-safe](Security.md#memory-safety), sandboxed [execution environment](Semantics.md#linear-memory) that may even be implemented inside existing JavaScript virtual machines.  When [embedded in the web](Web.md), WebAssembly will enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies of the browser.\n\n- **WebAssembly is open and debuggable**: WebAssembly is designed to be pretty-printed in a [textual format](TextFormat.md) for debugging, testing, experimenting, optimizing, learning, teaching, and writing programs by hand. The textual format will be used when [viewing the source](FAQ.md#will-webassembly-support-view-source-on-the-web) of wasm modules on the web.\n\n- **WebAssembly is part of the open web platform**: WebAssembly is designed to maintain the versionless, feature-tested, and backwards-compatible [nature of the web](Web.md). WebAssembly modules will be able to call into and out of the JavaScript context and access browser functionality through the same Web APIs accessible from JavaScript. WebAssembly also supports [non-web](NonWeb.md) embeddings.\n\n## More Information\n\n| Resource                                   | Repository Location      |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| High Level Goals                           | [design/HighLevelGoals.md](HighLevelGoals.md) |\n| Frequently Asked Questions                 | [design/FAQ.md](FAQ.md)            |\n| Language Specification                     | [spec/README.md](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec)           |\n\n## Design Process & Contributing\n\nThe WebAssembly specification is being developed in the [spec repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/). For now, high-level design discussions should continue to be held in the design repository, via issues and pull requests, so that the specification work can remain focused.\n\nWe've mapped out features we expect to ship:\n\n 1. An initial [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](MVP.md) release;\n 2. And soon after in [future versions][future general].\n\nJoin us:\n\n * In the [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/)\n \n     * Its moderated [announcement mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webassembly-announce/)\n     * Its [open-ended public discussion mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webassembly/)\n\n * On IRC: `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`\n * On Stack Overflow's [#webassembly tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webassembly#)\n * By [contributing](Contributing.md)!\n\nWhen contributing, please follow our [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md).\n\n[future general]: FutureFeatures.md\n"

            "text": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WebAssembly/wabt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WebAssembly/wabt) [![Windows status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8vl5jwtk5ch6r84t/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/WebAssembly/wabt/branch/master)\n\n# WABT: The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit\n\nWABT (we pronounce it \"wabbit\") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly, including:\n\n - [**wat2wasm**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wat2wasm.1.html): translate from [WebAssembly text format](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/index.html) to the [WebAssembly binary format](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/index.html)\n - [**wasm2wat**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm2wat.1.html): the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format back to the text format (also known as a .wat)\n - [**wasm-objdump**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-objdump.1.html): print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to objdump.\n - [**wasm-interp**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-interp.1.html): decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a stack-based interpreter\n - [**wat-desugar**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wat-desugar.1.html): parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print \"canonical\" flat format\n - [**wasm2c**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm2c.1.html): convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header\n - [**wasm-strip**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-strip.1.html): remove sections of a WebAssembly binary file\n - [**wasm-validate**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-validate.1.html): validate a file in the WebAssembly binary format\n - [**wast2json**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wast2json.1.html): convert a file in the wasm spec test format to a JSON file and associated wasm binary files\n - [**wasm-opcodecnt**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-opcodecnt.1.html): count opcode usage for instructions\n - [**spectest-interp**](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/spectest-interp.1.html): read a Spectest JSON file, and run its tests in the interpreter\n\nThese tools are intended for use in (or for development of) toolchains or other\nsystems that want to manipulate WebAssembly files. Unlike the WebAssembly spec\ninterpreter (which is written to be as simple, declarative and \"speccy\" as\npossible), they are written in C/C++ and designed for easier integration into\nother systems. Unlike [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) these\ntools do not aim to provide an optimization platform or a higher-level compiler\ntarget; instead they aim for full fidelity and compliance with the spec (e.g.\n1:1 round-trips with no changes to instructions).\n\n## Online Demos\n\nWabt has been compiled to JavaScript via emscripten. Some of the functionality is available in the following demos:\n\n- [index](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/)\n- [wat2wasm](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/)\n- [wasm2wat](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/)\n\n## Cloning\n\nClone as normal, but don't forget to get the submodules as well:\n\n```console\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt\n$ cd wabt\n```\n\nThis will fetch the testsuite and gtest repos, which are needed for some tests.\n\n## Building using CMake directly (Linux and macOS)\n\nYou'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org). You can then run CMake, the normal way:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake ..\n...\n```\n\nThis will produce build files using CMake's default build generator. Read the CMake\ndocumentation for more information.\n\n**NOTE**: You must create a separate directory for the build artifacts (e.g. `build` above).\nRunning `cmake` from the repo root directory will not work since the build produces an\nexecutable called `wasm2c` which conflicts with the `wasm2c` directory.\n\n## Building using the top-level `Makefile` (Linux and macOS)\n\n**NOTE**: Under the hood, this uses `make` to run CMake, which then calls `make` again.\nOn some systems (typically macOS), this doesn't build properly. If you see these errors,\nyou can build using CMake directly as described above.\n\nYou'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org). If you just run `make`, it will run CMake for you, \nand put the result in `out/clang/Debug/` by default:\n\n> Note: If you are on macOS, you will need to use CMake version 3.2 or higher\n\n```console\n$ make\n```\n\nThis will build the default version of the tools: a debug build using the Clang\ncompiler.\n\nThere are many make targets available for other configurations as well. They\nare generated from every combination of a compiler, build type and\nconfiguration.\n\n - compilers: `gcc`, `clang`, `gcc-i686`, `gcc-fuzz`\n - build types: `debug`, `release`\n - configurations: empty, `asan`, `msan`, `lsan`, `ubsan`, `no-re2c`,\n   `no-tests`\n\nThey are combined with dashes, for example:\n\n```console\n$ make clang-debug\n$ make gcc-i686-release\n$ make clang-debug-lsan\n$ make gcc-debug-no-re2c\n```\n\n## Building (Windows)\n\nYou'll need [CMake](https://cmake.org). You'll also need\n[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (2015 or newer) or \n[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).\n\nYou can run CMake from the command prompt, or use the CMake GUI tool. See\n[Running CMake](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/) for more information.\n\nWhen running from the commandline, create a new directory for the build\nartifacts, then run cmake from this directory:\n\n```console\n> cd [build dir]\n> cmake [wabt project root] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[config] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install directory] -G [generator]\n```\n\nThe `[config]` parameter should be a CMake build type, typically `DEBUG` or `RELEASE`.\n\nThe `[generator]` parameter should be the type of project you want to generate,\nfor example `\"Visual Studio 14 2015\"`. You can see the list of available\ngenerators by running `cmake --help`.\n\nTo build the project, you can use Visual Studio, or you can tell CMake to do it:\n\n```console\n> cmake --build [wabt project root] --config [config] --target install\n```\n\nThis will build and install to the installation directory you provided above.\n\nSo, for example, if you want to build the debug configuration on Visual Studio 2015:\n\n```console\n> mkdir build\n> cd build\n> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\\bin -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015\"\n> cmake --build . --config DEBUG --target install\n```\n\n## Changing the lexer\n\nIf you make changes to `src/wast-lexer.cc`, you'll need to install\n[re2c](http://re2c.org). Before you upload your PR, please run `make\nupdate-re2c` to update the prebuilt C sources in `src/prebuilt/`.\n\nCMake will detect if you don't have re2c installed and use the prebuilt source\nfiles instead.\n\n## Running wat2wasm and wast2json\n\nSome examples:\n\n```sh\n# parse and typecheck test.wat\n$ out/wat2wasm test.wat\n\n# parse test.wat and write to binary file test.wasm\n$ out/wat2wasm test.wat -o test.wasm\n\n# parse spec-test.wast, and write verbose output to stdout (including the\n# meaning of every byte)\n$ out/wat2wasm spec-test.wast -v\n\n# parse spec-test.wast, and write files to spec-test.json. Modules are written\n# to spec-test.0.wasm, spec-test.1.wasm, etc.\n$ out/wast2json spec-test.wast -o spec-test.json\n```\n\nYou can use `--help` to get additional help:\n\n```console\n$ out/wat2wasm --help\n```\n\nOr try the [online demo](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/).\n\n## Running wasm2wat\n\nSome examples:\n\n```sh\n# parse binary file test.wasm and write text file test.wat\n$ out/wasm2wat test.wasm -o test.wat\n\n# parse test.wasm and write test.wat\n$ out/wasm2wat test.wasm -o test.wat\n```\n\nYou can use `--help` to get additional help:\n\n```console\n$ out/wasm2wat --help\n```\n\nOr try the [online demo](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/).\n\n## Running wasm-interp\n\nSome examples:\n\n```sh\n# parse binary file test.wasm, and type-check it\n$ out/wasm-interp test.wasm\n\n# parse test.wasm and run all its exported functions\n$ out/wasm-interp test.wasm --run-all-exports\n\n# parse test.wasm, run the exported functions and trace the output\n$ out/wasm-interp test.wasm --run-all-exports --trace\n\n# parse test.json and run the spec tests\n$ out/wasm-interp test.json --spec\n\n# parse test.wasm and run all its exported functions, setting the value stack\n# size to 100 elements\n$ out/wasm-interp test.wasm -V 100 --run-all-exports\n```\n\nYou can use `--help` to get additional help:\n\n```console\n$ out/wasm-interp --help\n```\n\n## Running wasm2c\n\nSee [wasm2c.md](wasm2c/README.md)\n\n## Running the test suite\n\nSee [test/README.md](test/README.md).\n\n## Sanitizers\n\nTo build with the [LLVM sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers),\nappend the sanitizer name to the target:\n\n```console\n$ make clang-debug-asan\n$ make clang-debug-msan\n$ make clang-debug-lsan\n$ make clang-debug-ubsan\n```\n\nThere are configurations for the Address Sanitizer (ASAN), Memory Sanitizer\n(MSAN), Leak Sanitizer (LSAN) and Undefine Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN). You can\nread about the behaviors of the sanitizers in the link above, but essentially\nthe Address Sanitizer finds invalid memory accesses (use after free, access\nout-of-bounds, etc.), Memory Sanitizer finds uses of uninitialized memory, \nthe Leak Sanitizer finds memory leaks, and the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer\nfinds undefined behavior (surprise!).\n\nTypically, you'll just want to run all the tests for a given sanitizer:\n\n```console\n$ make test-asan\n```\n\nYou can also run the tests for a release build:\n\n```console\n$ make test-clang-release-asan\n...\n```\n\nThe Travis bots run all of these tests (and more). Before you land a change,\nyou should run them too. One easy way is to use the `test-everything` target:\n\n```console\n$ make test-everything\n```\n\nTo run everything the Travis bots do, you can use the following scripts:\n\n```console\n$ CC=gcc scripts/travis-build.sh\n$ CC=gcc scripts/travis-test.sh\n$ CC=clang scripts/travis-build.sh\n$ CC=clang scripts/travis-test.sh\n```\n"

It can load both the standard binary format, and the text format defined by the [WebAssembly reference interpreter](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/interpreter). For the text format, it can load both the standard stack machine syntax and the old-fashioned AST syntax used by the reference interpreter, and all of the testing commands.\n\n# Building and running it\n\nTo build it, you'll need CMake and [LLVM 6.0](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#6.0.0). If CMake can't find your LLVM directory, you can manually give it the location in the LLVM_DIR CMake configuration variable. Note that on Windows, you must compile LLVM from source, and manually point the LLVM_DIR configuration variable at `<LLVM build directory>\\lib\\cmake\\llvm`.\n\n### Building WAVM on Windows \n\n**1.) Install the [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools for Visual Studio 2015 or 2017](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)**\n\nTake note of which version you have installed:\n\n- If using Visual Studio 2015, use `-G\"Visual Studio 14 Win64\"` for the `<VS Generator Directive>` placeholder below\n- If using Visual Studio 2017, use `-G\"Visual Studio 15 Win64\"` for the `<VS Generator Directive>` placeholder below\n\n**2.) Build LLVM x64 on Windows with Visual Studio**\n\nCreate an llvm_build directory, navigate to that directory and run:\n\n    cmake -Thost=x64 <VS Generator Directive> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<desired install path for LLVM> <path to LLVM source>\n\nOpen the generated LLVM.sln locateed within the 'llvm_build' directory in Visual Studio and build the \"INSTALL\" Project\n\nThe output binaries should be located in `<desired install path for LLVM>`\n\n**3.) Build WAVM x64 on Windows with Visual Studio against LLVM x64**\n\nCreate a wavm_build directory, navigate to that directory and run:\n\n    cmake -Thost=x64 <VS Generator Directive> -DLLVM_DIR=<LLVM build directory>\\lib\\cmake\\llvm <path to WAVM source>\n\nOpen the generated WAVM.sln located within the 'wavm_build' directory in Visual Studio and build the \"ALL_BUILD\" Project\n\nThe output binaries should be located in `wavm_build\\bin`\n\n# Usage\n\nI've tested it on Windows with Visual C++ 2015/2017, Linux with GCC and clang, and MacOS with Xcode/clang. Travis CI is testing Linux/GCC, Linux/clang, and OSX/clang.\n\nThe primary executable is `wavm-run`:\n```\nUsage: wavm-run [switches] [programfile] [--] [arguments]\n  in.wast|in.wasm\t\tSpecify program file (.wast/.wasm)\n  -f|--function name\t\tSpecify function name to run in module rather than main\n  -c|--check\t\t\tExit after checking that the program is valid\n  -d|--debug\t\t\tWrite additional debug information to stdout\n  --\t\t\t\tStop parsing arguments\n```\n\n`wavm-run` will load a WebAssembly file and call `main` (or a specified function).  Example programs to try without changing any code include those found in the Examples and Test/spec directory such as the following:\n\n```\nwavm-run Examples/helloworld.wast\nwavm-run Examples/Benchmark/Benchmark.wast\nwavm-run Examples/zlib.wast\n```\n\nWebAssembly programs that export a main function with the standard parameters will be passed in the command line arguments.  If the same main function returns a i32 type it will become the exit code.  WAVM supports Emscripten's defined I/O functions so programs can read from stdin and write to stdout and stderr.  See [echo.wast](Examples/echo.wast) for an example of a program that echos the command line arguments back out through stdout.\n\nThere are a few additional executables that can be used to assemble the WAST file into a binary:\n\n```\nwavm-as in.wast out.wasm\n```\n\nwavm-disas a binary into a WAST file:\n\n```\nwavm-disas in.wasm out.wast\n```\n\nand to execute a test script defined by a WAST file (see the [Test/spec directory](Test/spec) for examples of the syntax):\n\n```\nTest in.wast\n```\n\n# Architecture\n\n## IR\n\nThe [IR](Include/WAVM/IR) (Intermediate Representation) is the glue that the WAST parser, the WASM serialization, and the Runtime communicate through. It closely mirrors the semantics of the WebAssembly binary format, but is easier to work with in memory.\n\n## Parsing\n\nParsing the WebAssembly text format uses a table-driven deterministic finite automaton to scan the input string for tokens. The tables are generated from a set of tokens that match literal strings, and a set of tokens that match regular expressions. The parser is a standard recursive descent parser.\n\n## Runtime\n\nThe [Runtime](Lib/Runtime/) is the primary consumer of the byte code. It provides an [API](Include/WAVM/Runtime/Runtime.h) for instantiating WebAssembly modules and calling functions exported from them. To instantiate a module,\n1) Translates the byte code into LLVM IR([1](Lib/LLVMJIT/EmitModule.cpp), [2](Lib/LLVMJIT/EmitFunction.cpp), and the various `Emit*.cpp` in [Lib/LLVMJIT](Lib/LLVMJIT))\n2) [Uses LLVM to compile the LLVM IR to object code](Lib/LLVMJIT/LLVMCompile.cpp) for the module's functions, with symbols in place of literal values for things like the module's imports.\n3) [Instantiates the module's runtime environment](Lib/Runtime/Module.cpp) (globals, memory objects, and table objects).\n4) [Loads the object code](Lib/LLVMJIT/LLVMModule.cpp) created by step 2, replacing symbols with the appropriate values from the module's environment.\n\n# License\n\nWAVM is provided under the terms of [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).\n"

To publish, check in manually built static site files to the `docs` directory.\n\nThe static site should be configured to build to the `docs` directory. The `docs` directory is a special directory from which GitHub pages can publish directly. The naming convention is unfortunate given the confusing overlap with the site's own `docs` pages (output to `docs/docs`) which are themselves generated from the design docs submodule located at `design`.\n\n## What is the role of `_config.yml` and the custom Jekyll plugins?\n\n> Note: the following plugins are all hacks to make the workflow of generating website docs from the `design` repo work without updating the sources in the design repo.\n\n- `gem 'jekyll-optional-front-matter'` loaded directly in the `Gemfile` allows markdown files without YAML frontmatter to be consumed directly. This is included to allow `design` repo `.md` files to be used as pages without modifying their source to add frontmatter.\n- `gem 'jemoji'` loaded directly in the `Gemfile` replaces GitHub-style emoji markdown (e.g. `:+1:`) with images for compat.\n- The `defaults` section of `_config.yml` adds default values to the YAML frontmatter of documents from the `design` repo. In particular, it specifies that all `.md` files in the design submodule should be labelled as type `doc` and given layout `doc.html`. It also manually moves a few docs into the `community` tree where they fit the site organization better.\n- `auto_titles.rb` adds a `title` value to YAML frontmatter by looking for the first header tag in the source files. It also orders the design docs based on a hardcoded list.\n- `link_converter.rb` turns the `design` repo's links (e.g. `[threads](FutureFeatures.md#threads)`) into their respective locations on this website (e.g. `[threads](/docs/future-features/#threads)`).\n- `underscore_paths.rb` rewrites Jekyll page permalinks to convert `/design/FutureFeatures/` to `/docs/future-features/`.\n"

It aims to make [compiling to WebAssembly] **easy, fast, and\neffective**:\n\n * **Easy**: Binaryen has a simple [C API] in a single header, and can also be\n   [used from JavaScript][JS_API]. It accepts input in [WebAssembly-like\n   form][compile_to_wasm] but also accepts a general [control flow graph] for\n   compilers that prefer that.\n\n * **Fast**: Binaryen's internal IR uses compact data structures and is designed\n   for completely parallel codegen and optimization, using all available CPU\n   cores. Binaryen's IR also compiles down to WebAssembly extremely easily and\n   quickly because it is essentially a subset of WebAssembly.\n\n * **Effective**: Binaryen's optimizer has many [passes] that can improve code\n   very significantly (e.g. local coloring to coalesce local variables; dead\n   code elimination; precomputing expressions when possible at compile time;\n   etc.). These optimizations aim to make Binaryen powerful enough to be used as\n   a [compiler backend][backend] by itself.  One specific area of focus is on\n   WebAssembly-specific optimizations (that general-purpose compilers might not\n   do), which you can think of as wasm [minification] , similar to minification\n   for JavaScript, CSS, etc., all of which are language-specific (an example of\n   such an optimization is block return value generation in `SimplifyLocals`).\n\nCompilers built using Binaryen include\n\n * [`asm2wasm`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/master/src/asm2wasm.h) which compiles asm.js to WebAssembly\n * [`AssemblyScript`](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) which compiles TypeScript to Binaryen IR\n * [`wasm2js`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/master/src/wasm2js.h) which compiles WebAssembly to JS\n * [`Asterius`](https://github.com/tweag/asterius) which compiles Haskell to WebAssembly\n\nBinaryen also provides a set of **toolchain utilities** that can\n\n * **Parse** and **emit** WebAssembly. In particular this lets you load\n   WebAssembly, optimize it using Binaryen, and re-emit it, thus implementing a\n   wasm-to-wasm optimizer in a single command.\n * **Interpret** WebAssembly as well as run the WebAssembly spec tests.\n * Integrate with **[Emscripten](http://emscripten.org)** in order to provide a\n   complete compiler toolchain from C and C++ to WebAssembly.\n * **Polyfill** WebAssembly by running it in the interpreter compiled to\n   JavaScript, if the browser does not yet have native support (useful for\n   testing).\n\nConsult the [contributing instructions](Contributing.md) if you're interested in\nparticipating.\n\n## Binaryen IR\n\nBinaryen's internal IR is designed to be\n\n * **Flexible and fast** for optimization.\n * **As close as possible to WebAssembly** so it is simple and fast to convert\n   it to and from WebAssembly.\n\nThere are a few differences between Binaryen IR and the WebAssembly language:\n\n * Tree structure\n   * Binaryen IR [is a tree][binaryen_ir], i.e., it has hierarchical structure,\n     for convenience of optimization. This differs from the WebAssembly binary\n     format which is a stack machine.\n   * Consequently Binaryen's text format allows only s-expressions.\n     WebAssembly's official text format is primarily a linear instruction list\n     (with s-expression extensions). Binaryen can't read the linear style, but\n     it can read a wasm text file if it contains only s-expressions.\n * Types and unreachable code\n   * WebAssembly limits block/if/loop types to none and the concrete value types\n     (i32, i64, f32, f64). Binaryen IR has an unreachable type, and it allows\n     block/if/loop to take it, allowing [local transforms that don't need to\n     know the global context][unreachable]. As a result, Binaryen's default\n     text output is not necessarily valid wasm text. (To get valid wasm text,\n     you can do `--generate-stack-ir --print-stack-ir`, which prints Stack IR,\n     this is guaranteed to be valid for wasm parsers.)\n   * Binaryen ignores unreachable code when reading WebAssembly binaries. That\n     means that if you read a wasm file with unreachable code, that code will be\n     discarded as if it were optimized out (often this is what you want anyhow,\n     and optimized programs have no unreachable code anyway, but if you write an\n     unoptimized file and then read it, it may look different). The reason for\n     this behavior is that unreachable code in WebAssembly has corner cases that\n     are tricky to handle in Binaryen IR (it can be very unstructured, and\n     Binaryen IR is more structured than WebAssembly as noted earlier). Note\n     that Binaryen does support unreachable code in .wat text files, since as we\n     saw Binaryen only supports s-expressions there, which are structured.\n * Blocks\n   * Binaryen IR has only one node that contains a variable-length list of\n     operands: the block. WebAssembly on the other hand allows lists in loops,\n     if arms, and the top level of a function. Binaryen's IR has a single\n     operand for all non-block nodes; this operand may of course be a block.\n     The motivation for this property is that many passes need special code\n     for iterating on lists, so having a single IR node with a list simplifies\n     them.\n   * As in wasm, blocks and loops may have names. Branch targets in the IR are\n     resolved by name (as opposed to nesting depth). This has 2 consequences:\n     * Blocks without names may not be branch targets.\n     * Names are required to be unique. (Reading .wat files with duplicate names\n       is supported; the names are modified when the IR is constructed).\n   * As an optimization, a block that is the child of a loop (or if arm, or\n     function toplevel) and which has no branches targeting it will not be\n     emitted when generating wasm. Instead its list of operands will be directly\n     used in the containing node. Such a block is sometimes called an \"implicit\n     block\".\n\nAs a result, you might notice that round-trip conversions (wasm => Binaryen IR\n=> wasm) change code a little in some corner cases.\n\n * When optimizing Binaryen uses an additional IR, Stack IR (see\n   `src/wasm-stack.h`). Stack IR allows a bunch of optimizations that are\n   tailored for the stack machine form of WebAssembly's binary format (but Stack\n   IR is less efficient for general optimizations than the main Binaryen IR). If\n   you have a wasm file that has been particularly well-optimized, a simple\n   round-trip conversion (just read and write, without optimization) may cause\n   more noticeable differences, as Binaryen fits it into Binaryen IR's more\n   structured format. If you also optimize during the round-trip conversion then\n   Stack IR opts will be run and the final wasm will be better optimized.\n\nNotes when working with Binaryen IR:\n\n * As mentioned above, Binaryen IR has a tree structure. As a result, each\n   expression should have exactly one parent - you should not \"reuse\" a node by\n   having it appear more than once in the tree. The motivation for this\n   limitation is that when we optimize we modify nodes, so if they appear more\n   than once in the tree, a change in one place can appear in another\n   incorrectly.\n * For similar reasons, nodes should not appear in more than one functions.\n\n## Tools\n\nThis repository contains code that builds the following tools in `bin/`:\n\n * **wasm-shell**: A shell that can load and interpret WebAssembly code. It can\n   also run the spec test suite.\n * **wasm-as**: Assembles WebAssembly in text format (currently S-Expression\n   format) into binary format (going through Binaryen IR).\n * **wasm-dis**: Un-assembles WebAssembly in binary format into text format\n   (going through Binaryen IR).\n * **wasm-opt**: Loads WebAssembly and runs Binaryen IR passes on it.\n * **asm2wasm**: An asm.js-to-WebAssembly compiler, using Emscripten's asm\n   optimizer infrastructure. This is used by Emscripten in Binaryen mode when it\n   uses Emscripten's fastcomp asm.js backend.\n * **wasm2js**: A WebAssembly-to-JS compiler (still experimental).\n * **wasm-merge**: Combines wasm files into a single big wasm file (without\n   sophisticated linking).\n * **wasm-ctor-eval**: A tool that can execute C++ global constructors ahead of\n   time. Used by Emscripten.\n * **wasm-emscripten-finalize**: Takes a wasm binary produced by llvm+lld and\n   performs emscripten-specific passes over it.\n * **binaryen.js**: A standalone JavaScript library that exposes Binaryen methods for [creating and optimizing WASM modules](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/master/test/binaryen.js/hello-world.js). For builds, see [binaryen.js on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binaryen) (or download it directly from [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AssemblyScript/binaryen.js/master/index.js), [rawgit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AssemblyScript/binaryen.js/master/index.js), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/binaryen@latest/index.js)).\n\nUsage instructions for each are below.\n\n## Building\n\n```\ncmake . && make\n```\nNote that you can also use `ninja` as your generator: `cmake -G Ninja . && ninja`\n\n* A C++11 compiler is required.\n* The JavaScript components can be built using `build-js.sh`, see notes inside. Normally this is not needed as builds are provided in this repo already.\n\nIf you also want to compile C/C++ to WebAssembly (and not just asm.js to WebAssembly), you'll need Emscripten. You'll need the `incoming` branch there (which you can get via [the SDK](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)), for more details see [the wiki](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/WebAssembly).\n\n### Visual C++\n\n1. Using the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer, install the \"Visual C++ tools for CMake\" component.\n\n1. Generate the projects:\n\n   ```\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   \"%VISUAL_STUDIO_ROOT%\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe\" ..\n   ```\n\n   Substitute VISUAL_STUDIO_ROOT with the path to your Visual Studio\n   installation. In case you are using the Visual Studio Build Tools, the path\n   will be \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools\".\n\n1. From the Developer Command Prompt, build the desired projects:\n\n   ```\n   msbuild binaryen.vcxproj\n   ```\n\n   CMake generates a project named \"ALL_BUILD.vcxproj\" for conveniently building all the projects.\n\n## Running\n\n### wasm-opt\n\nRun\n\n````\nbin/wasm-opt [.wasm or .wat file] [options] [passes, see --help] [--help]\n````\n\nThe wasm optimizer receives WebAssembly as input, and can run transformation\npasses on it, as well as print it (before and/or after the transformations). For\nexample, try\n\n````\nbin/wasm-opt test/passes/lower-if-else.wast --print\n````\n\nThat will pretty-print out one of the test cases in the test suite. To run a\ntransformation pass on it, try\n\n````\nbin/wasm-opt test/passes/lower-if-else.wast --print --lower-if-else\n````\n\nThe `lower-if-else` pass lowers if-else into a block and a break. You can see\nthe change the transformation causes by comparing the output of the two print\ncommands.\n\nIt's easy to add your own transformation passes to the shell, just add `.cpp`\nfiles into `src/passes`, and rebuild the shell. For example code, take a look at\nthe [`lower-if-else` pass](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/master/src/passes/LowerIfElse.cpp).\n\nSome more notes:\n\n * See `bin/wasm-opt --help` for the full list of options and passes.\n * Passing `--debug` will emit some debugging info.\n\n### asm2wasm\n\nrun\n\n```\nbin/asm2wasm [input.asm.js file]\n```\n\nThis will print out a WebAssembly module in s-expression format to the console.\n\nFor example, try\n\n```\n$ bin/asm2wasm test/hello_world.asm.js\n```\n\nThat input file contains\n\n```javascript\nfunction () {\n  \"use asm\";\n  function add(x, y) {\n    x = x | 0;\n    y = y | 0;\n    return x + y | 0;\n  }\n  return { add: add };\n}\n```\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n![example output](https://raw.github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-emscripten/master/media/example.png)\n\nBy default you should see pretty colors as in that image. Set `COLORS=0` in the\nenv to disable colors if you prefer that. On Linux and Mac, you can set\n`COLORS=1` in the env to force colors (useful when piping to `more`, for\nexample). For Windows, pretty colors are only available when `stdout/stderr` are\nnot redirected/piped.\n\nPass `--debug` on the command line to see debug info, about asm.js functions as\nthey are parsed, etc.\n\n### C/C++ Source ⇒ asm2wasm ⇒ WebAssembly\n\nWhen using `emcc` with the `BINARYEN` option, it will use Binaryen to build to\nWebAssembly. This lets you compile C and C++ to WebAssembly, with emscripten\nusing asm.js internally as a build step. Since emscripten's asm.js generation is\nvery stable, and asm2wasm is a fairly simple process, this method of compiling C\nand C++ to WebAssembly is usable already. See the [emscripten\nwiki](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/WebAssembly) for more details\nabout how to use it.\n\n## Testing\n\n```\n./check.py\n```\n\n(or `python check.py`) will run `wasm-shell`, `wasm-opt`, `asm2wasm`, etc. on the testcases in `test/`, and verify their outputs.\n\nThe `check.py` script supports some options:\n\n```\n./check.py [--interpreter=/path/to/interpreter] [TEST1] [TEST2]..\n```\n\n * If an interpreter is provided, we run the output through it, checking for\n   parse errors.\n * If tests are provided, we run exactly those. If none are provided, we run\n   them all.\n * Some tests require `emcc` or `nodejs` in the path. They will not run if the\n   tool cannot be found, and you'll see a warning.\n * We have tests from upstream in `tests/spec`, in git submodules. Running\n   `./check.py` should update those.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n * **Interned strings for names**: It's very convenient to have names on nodes,\n   instead of just numeric indices etc. To avoid most of the performance\n   difference between strings and numeric indices, all strings are interned,\n   which means there is a single copy of each string in memory, string\n   comparisons are just a pointer comparison, etc.\n * **Allocate in arenas**: Based on experience with other\n   optimizing/transformating toolchains, it's not worth the overhead to\n   carefully track memory of individual nodes. Instead, we allocate all elements\n   of a module in an arena, and the entire arena can be freed when the module is\n   no longer needed.\n\n## FAQ\n\n* How does `asm2wasm` relate to the new WebAssembly backend which is being\n  developed in upstream LLVM?\n\nThis is separate from that. `asm2wasm` focuses on compiling asm.js to\nWebAssembly, as emitted by Emscripten's asm.js backend. This is useful because\nwhile in the long term Emscripten hopes to use the new WebAssembly backend, the\n`asm2wasm` route is a very quick and easy way to generate WebAssembly output.\nIt will also be useful for benchmarking the new backend as it progresses.\n\n* How about compiling WebAssembly to asm.js (the opposite direction of\n  `asm2wasm`)? Wouldn't that be useful for polyfilling?\n\nExperimentation with this is happening, in `wasm2js`.\n\nThis would be useful, but it is a much harder task, due to some decisions made\nin WebAssembly. For example, WebAssembly can have control flow nested inside\nexpressions, which can't directly map to asm.js. It could be supported by\noutlining the code to another function, or to compiling it down into new basic\nblocks and control-flow-free instructions, but it is hard to do so in a way that\nis both fast to do and emits code that is fast to execute. On the other hand,\ncompiling asm.js to WebAssembly is almost straightforward.\n\nWe just have to do more work on `wasm2js` and see how efficient we can make it.\n\n* Can `asm2wasm` compile any asm.js code?\n\nAlmost. Some decisions made in WebAssembly preclude that, for example, there are\nno global variables. That means that `asm2wasm` has to map asm.js global\nvariables onto locations in memory, but then it must know of a safe zone in\nmemory in which to do so, and that information is not directly available in\nasm.js.\n\n`asm2wasm` do some integration with Emscripten in order to work around these\nissues, like asking Emscripten to reserve same space for the globals, etc.\n\n* Why the weird name for the project?\n\n\"Binaryen\" is a combination of **binary** - since WebAssembly is a binary format\nfor the web - and **Emscripten** - with which it can integrate in order to\ncompile C and C++ all the way to WebAssembly, via asm.js. Binaryen began as\nEmscripten's WebAssembly processing library (`wasm-emscripten`).\n\n\"Binaryen\" is pronounced [in the same manner](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2011/2/11/official-pronunciation-guide-for-game-of-thrones.html) as \"[Targaryen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters#House_Targaryen)\": *bi-NAIR-ee-in*. Or something like that? Anyhow, however Targaryen is correctly pronounced, they should rhyme. Aside from pronunciation, the Targaryen house words, \"Fire and Blood\", have also inspired Binaryen's: \"Code and Bugs.\"\n\n* Does it compile under Windows and/or Visual Studio?\n\nYes, it does. Here's a step-by-step [tutorial][win32]  on how to compile it\nunder **Windows 10 x64** with with **CMake** and **Visual Studio 2015**. Help\nwould be appreciated on Windows and OS X as most of the core devs are on Linux.\n\n[compiling to WebAssembly]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Compiling-to-WebAssembly-with-Binaryen\n[win32]: https://github.com/brakmic/bazaar/blob/master/webassembly/COMPILING_WIN32.md\n[C API]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Compiling-to-WebAssembly-with-Binaryen#c-api-1\n[control flow graph]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Compiling-to-WebAssembly-with-Binaryen#cfg-api\n[JS_API]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/binaryen.js-API\n[compile_to_wasm]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Compiling-to-WebAssembly-with-Binaryen#what-do-i-need-to-have-in-order-to-use-binaryen-to-compile-to-webassembly\n[passes]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/tree/master/src/passes\n[backend]: https://kripken.github.io/talks/binaryen.html#/9\n[minification]: https://kripken.github.io/talks/binaryen.html#/2\n[unreachable]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/903\n[binaryen_ir]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/663\n"

You may want to see [the waterfall][] in action, and if you don't like\nwhat you see you may even want to [contribute](Contributing.md).\n\n  [the waterfall]: https://wasm-stat.us\n\n# What's a waterfall?\n\nWebAssembly has many moving parts (implementations, tools, tests, etc) and no\ncentral owner. All of these parts have have their own owners, priorities, and\ntests (which include WebAssembly as well as others).  A build and test waterfall\nallows us to test the interactions between these components. It helps us:\n\n* Have simple build instructions for each component.\n* Archive build logs and build artifacts.\n* Identify which build artifacts are known-good.\n* Know which tests matter.\n* Make tests easily executable.\n* Know which configurations matter (build flavor, host OS, host architecture,\n  ...).\n* Cause inadvertent breakage less often.\n* When breakage occurs, identify it quickly and reverted / silenced / fixed\n  easily.\n* When a big change is required, know which moving parts should synchronize.\n* Make the feature implementation status straightforward to check for each\n  component.\n\nWe should keep process to a minimum, try things out, see what works.\n\n# How do I run it?\n\n1. Get the sources: `$ git clone https://github.com/WebAssembly/waterfall.git`\n2. Run build.py `python src/build.py`\n\nBuild.py has 3 types of actions:\n* downloading/updating sources for tools and engines (sync)\n* building those sources (build)\n* running tests against them (test).\n\nEach of these types has multiple steps (e.g. a build step for each component).\nIf you run build.py with no arguments, it will run all the sync, build, and test\nsteps. If you make a change and only want to run a subset of steps, you can\napply filters from the command line, via exclusions (to prevent specified steps\nfrom running) or inclusions (to run only the specified steps). Sync, build, and\ntest exclusions are specified separately.  For example:\n\n1. Do not sync any sources, build everything except LLVM, and run all tests:\n  `$ src/build.py --no-sync --build-exclude=llvm`\n2. Sync only WABT, build WABT and Binaryen, run everything other than the\n   emscripten testsuites:\n  `$ src/build.py --sync-include=wabt --build-include=wabt,binaryen --test-exclude=emtest,emtest-asm`\n\nThe script should throw an error if you specify nonexistent steps or if you\nspecify both includes and excludes for the same type of action.\n\nWhen run, the script creates a directory `src/work` inside the waterfall's git\ncheckout. All modifications are made inside this directory (checking and out and\nbuilding the sources, as well as the test builds and execution results). You can\nalso use the git checkouts (e.g. `src/work/llvm`) with your own branches; the\nsync steps will check out the latest revision from the script's remote\nrepositories but will not overwrite or destroy any local work.\n"

This includes descriptions of\nintermediate file formats, conventions for mapping high-level language types,\nnames, and abstraction features to WebAssembly types, identifiers, and\nimplementations, and schemes for supporting debuggers or other tools.\n\nThese conventions are not part of the WebAssembly standard, and are not required\nof WebAssembly-consuming implementations to execute WebAssembly code. Tools\nproducing and working with WebAssembly in other ways also need not follow any of\nthese conventions. They exist only to support tools that wish to interoperate\nwith other tools at a higher abstraction level than just WebAssembly itself.\n\nThese conventions are also not exclusive. There could be multiple conventions\nfor a given language for a given purpose. There are natural benefits to\ninteroperability, but there are many reasons where having more than one way to\ndo things can also make sense in many circumstances.\n"

We'd love to share it! Please\nfeel free to create a PR against this repo.\n\nThe workload should contain a LICENSE in the root directory that is sufficiently\npermissive as to allow:\n* copying the workload into various engine or toolchain test harnesses\n* hosting the workload via this and other GitHub Pages\n\nIf sources are provided, they should include build instructions and the LICENSE\nshould permit modification of the workload for measurement and experimental\npurposes.\n"

            "text": "# WebAssembly C and C++ API \n\nWork in progress! No docs yet.\n\n\n### Design Goals\n\n* Provide a \"black box\" API for embedding a Wasm engine in other C/C++ applications.\n\n  * Be completely agnostic to VM specifics.\n\n  * Non-goal: \"white box\" interoperability with embedder (such as combined GC instead of mere finalisation) -- *much* more difficult to achieve.\n\n* Allow creation of bindings for other languages through typical C foreign function interfaces.\n\n  * Support a plain C API.\n\n  * Stick to mostly manual memory management of interface objects.\n\n* Avoid language features that raise barrier to use.\n\n  * E.g., no exceptions or post-C++11 features in C++ API.\n\n  * E.g., no passing of structs by-value or post-C99 features in C API.\n\n* Achieve link-time compatibility between different implementations.\n\n  * All implementation-dependent API classes are abstract and can be instantiated through factory methods only.\n\n\n### Interfaces\n\n* C++ API:\n\n  * See `include/wasm.hh` for interface.\n\n  * See `example/*.cc` for example usages.\n\n* C API:\n\n  * See `include/wasm.h` for interface.\n\n  * See `example/*.c` for example usages.\n\nSome random explanations:\n\n* The VM must be initialised by creating an instance of an *engine* (`wasm::Engine`/`wasm_engine_t`) and is shut down by deleting it. Such an instance may only be created once per process.\n\n* All runtime objects are tied to a specific *store* (`wasm::Store`/`wasm_store_t`). Multiple stores can be created, but their objects cannot interact. Every store and its objects must only be accessed in a single thread.\n\n* To exchange module objects between threads, create a *shared* module (`wasm::Shared<Module>`/`wasm_shared_module_t`). Other objects cannot be shared in current Wasm.\n\n* *Vector* structures (`wasm::vec<X>`/`wasm_x_vec_t`) are lightweight abstractions of a pair of a plain array and its length. The C++ API does not use `std::vector` because that does not support adopting pre-existing arrays.\n\n* *References* point to runtime objects, but may involve internal indirections, which may or may not be cached. Thus, pointer equality on `Ref*` or subclasses cannot be used to compare identity of the underlying objects (`Ref::eq` may be added later). However, `nullptr`/`NULL` uniquely represents null references.\n\n* The API already encompasses current proposals like [multiple return values](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value/blob/master/proposals/multi-value/Overview.md) and [reference types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md), but not yet [threads](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/blob/master/proposals/threads/Overview.md).\n\n\n### Implementation\n\n* A prototype implementation based on V8 is in `src`.\n\n  * Note that this requires adding a module to V8, so it patches V8's build file.\n\n* The C API is implemented on top of the C++ API.\n\n* See `Makefile` for build recipe. Canonical steps to run examples:\n\n  1. `make v8-checkout`\n  2. `make v8`\n  3. `make all`\n\n\n#### Limitations\n\nV8 implementation:\n\n* Currently requires patching V8 by adding a module.\n\n* Host functions (`Func::make`) create a JavaScript function internally, since V8 cannot handle raw C imports yet.\n\n* As a consequence, does not support multiple results in external calls or host functions.\n\n* Host functions and host globals are created through auxiliary modules constructed on the fly, to work around limitations in JS API.\n\n* `Shared<Module>` is currently implemented via serialisation, since V8 does not currently have direct support for cross-isolate sharing.\n\n\n### TODO\n\nPossible API tweaks:\n\n  * Add `Ref::eq` (or better, a subclass `EqRef::eq`) for reference equality?\n\n  * Avoid allocation for `Result` objects by making them into out parameters?\n\n  * Use `restrict` in C API?\n\n  * Distinguish vec and own_vec in C++ API?\n\n  * Handle constness of vectors properly in C API?\n\n  * Find a way to perform C callbacks through C++ without extra wrapper?\n\n  * Add iterators to `vec` class?\n\nV8 implementation:\n\n  * Find a way to avoid external calls through JS?\n\n  * Use reference counting and caching for types?\n"

While it's intended to\n(eventually) be usable in its own right, we fully expect other\nimplementations to be used in practice by many different systems, though\nwe do hope that in those cases, this library defines a useful ABI that can\nbe followed.\n\n## Usage\n\nObtain a WebAssembly-supporting C compiler, and then run:\n\n```\nmake WASM_CC=/path/to/wasm/supporting/c/compiler\n```\n\nThis makes a directory called \"sysroot\", by default. See the top of the Makefile\nfor customization options.\n\nTo use the sysroot, use the `--sysroot=` option:\n\n```\n/path/to/wasm/supporting/c/compiler --sysroot=/path/to/the/newly/built/sysroot ...\n```\n\nto run the compiler using the newly built sysroot.\n\n## Why doesn't this contain a full libc implementation?\n\nIn the short term, one of the main goals is just to provide a reference\npoint for people already maintaining their own libc codebases, to help\nreduce interface incompatibilities between the several different\nenvironments out there.\n\nIn the long term, there may some day be some form of standardized\nsyscall/import layer for wasm which would could support a full\n\"reference libc\", at which point this repository might make sense as\na place to host such a thing.\n\nIn between, if there are specific pieces of libc functionality which\npeople would find useful to have here, and which don't depend on any\nsyscalls, we could add them, using code from existing third-party\ncodebases as appropriate.\n"

(TBD)\n\nOriginal `README` from upstream repository follows...\n\n# spec\n\nThis repository holds a prototypical reference implementation for WebAssembly,\nwhich is currently serving as the official specification. Eventually, we expect\nto produce a specification either written in human-readable prose or in a formal\nspecification language.\n\nIt also holds the WebAssembly testsuite, which tests numerous aspects of\nconformance to the spec.\n\nView the work-in-progress spec at [webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/).\n\nAt this time, the contents of this repository are under development and known\nto be \"incomplet and inkorrect\".\n\nParticipation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic\nchanges, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion\nshould take place in\n[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)\nfirst, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the\n[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).\n"

Let's make the Web rock our socks\noff!\n\nMedia Source Extensions:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/\n\n\nMedia Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/byte-stream-format-registry.html\n\nWebM Byte Stream Format\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/webm-byte-stream-format.html\n\nISO BMFF Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/isobmff-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG-2 Transport Streams Byte Stream Format:\nhttp://w3c.github.io/media-source/mp2t-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG Audio Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/mpeg-audio-byte-stream-format.html\n\n# Issue labeling and milestone guidance\n\n## Labels\nEach bug may have multiple labels.\n\n### “needs feedback”:\nThe issue is pending further clarification from the assignee, likely the original bug filer or another who reported aspects of the issue in the bug’s history. The feedback request needs to be in a comment associated with the addition of this label, along with a request for reassignment back to an editor once feedback is provided.\n\n### “needs author input”:\nThe editors are seeking input from web authors on the issue. For example, whether a requested change is useful or how best to expose information.\n\n### “needs follow-up”:\nThe assignee, likely an editor, needs to investigate more deeply before we can decide if this “needs implementation” or to otherwise move forward. The editors have discussed the issue and do not need to discuss it further until we have the resulting follow-up from the assignee. This includes things like determining external spec dependencies, seeking input from other spec owners and/or WGs, confirming the understanding of the nature of the bug, and beginning to formulate a path to a solution.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean follow-up has “Started” or is “In Progress.”\n\n### “needs implementation”:\nThe steps needed to resolve this issue are clearly understood and agreed upon. This likely means drafting and committing a spec change, possibly via a pull request. No further discussion is necessary at this time, though review of the change may still be appropriate. Should that change, this label should be removed.\n\nFor a bug to be labeled with this, it needs to be understood well enough and in scope of the marked milestone. Otherwise, “needs follow-up” or punting milestone might be options.\n\nThis label does not refer to user agent implementations.\n\n### “blocked”:\nSome external dependency or another GitHub issue identified in comment associated with this label’s addition is (or might be) blocking progress on this bug.\n\n### “feature request”:\nThe issue is related to or requesting a new use case or capability not currently (explicitly) covered by the spec. Depending on the nature and impact of the request and the stage of the spec, it may be assigned to a future milestone.\n\n### “interoperability”:\nResolution of this issue is particularly important for interoperability among user agents. This may include breaking API changes, issues related to media compatibility across user agents, or ambiguous parts of the spec that could lead to different incompatible interpretations. There may be known or probable differing interpretations in implementations of the associated portion of the spec. If the identified issue is not addressed, there is a high likelihood of meaningful interoperability problems. The fix for the issue would need to provide a clear direction to prevent differing interpretations by user agents.\n\n### \"breaking change\"\nThe issue's resolution might cause re-entry to the current spec phase, for example CR.\n\n### “wontfix”, “invalid”, “duplicate”:\nSelf-explanatory :)\n\nIssues with these labels should always be closed (unless they were re-opened at which time an editor should probably remove these labels if the re-opening is accepted).\n\n\n## Milestones\nFor greater detail, see our V1 triage process announcement in [the archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2016Mar/0003.html).\n\n### “V#”:\nA bug in version # of the spec.\nCurrently, V1 is the first version of MSE (in CR in Q4 2015).\n\n### \"V#NonBlocking\"\nA bug in version # of the spec, which is an editorial change to improve spec language. These should not be treated as blocking on the WG timeline, so the clock may run out before all are fixed.\n\n### “VNext”:\nPerhaps to be addressed by some later version of the spec; not currently expected to be in scope of specific version of the spec. Typically, this milestone is correlated with issues labeled “feature request”. This is equivalent to Bugzilla’s RESOLVED LATER status. As such and to keep the issue tracker focused, issues with this milestone will generally be closed. When work on a new version of the spec starts, the V.Next issues, including those that are closed, should be reviewed and considered for the new version.\n\n### (no milestone):\nThe issue has not been triaged or the editors are currently discussing.\n"

This is prohibitive to the goal of creating modular, independent components, often requiring a number of redundant CSS, complex exception cases, and workarounds, and the problem compounds itself depending on how dramatically a module adapts at each of its breakpoints.\n\nThis document aims to present some of the use cases that an “element query” syntax would solve, by allowing authors to define layouts within an individual module on the basis of the size of the module itself, rather than the viewport.\n\nThe spec proper can be found at <https://wicg.github.io/cq-usecases/>.\n\n## Found a bug?

Media keys, like play, pause, fast forward and rewind, are found on keyboards, headsets, remote controls, and on lock screens of mobile devices.\n\n## Explainer\n\nThe explainer of the MediaSession API can be found [here](explainer.md).\n\n## Use cases\n\nThe use cases of the MediaSession API can be found [here](use_cases.md).\n\n## Extensibility\nOur goal is to provide developers with low-level primitives that both help explain the platform, while also allowing developers to build rich multimedia experiences that leverage media key events. Keeping to our commitment to the [extensible web manifesto](https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/), we want to allow the media key events to be routed to wherever you need them in your web application. At the same time, we want to make sure that whatever solution we come up with is easy to use &ndash; by possibly extending existing HTML elements or APIs.\n\n## Limitations\nAccess to media keys and lock screen UI will only be granted when audio playback begins, ensuring that audio focus is not taken from another application prematurely and that lock screen UI is only shown when it can be used. This matches the [iOS model](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/Remote-ControlEvents/Remote-ControlEvents.html).\n\n## Contribute\n\nThis spec is built using [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).\n\nUpdate `index.bs` and send a Pull Request with your changes. When your Pull Request will be merged, a new `index.html` will be generated. If you want to test locally, you can run `make` to generate `index.html` using [Bikeshed's web interface](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/). However, you should not send the `index.html` file in your Pull Request.\n\nTo run Bikeshed locally, [install Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/prespec/docs/install.md) and then run `bikeshed spec` in the working directory.\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute! However, you need [join WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) first and sign the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nWe are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Accessibility in browsers is enabled today by putting markup in web content, but this approach can be difficult for app developers to apply in practice.\n\nThe intent of this work is to take different APIs that are under development for this purpose, specifically Microsoft [WAPA](https://github.com/cyns/wapa) proposal, the Mozilla Web Accessibility API project, and the [IndieUI Events draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events/), and native platform APIs and work toward a single specification, guidance for mapping to platform APIs, and suggestions to platform implementers on how to fill holes in those APIs.\n"

            "text": "**Deprecated:** Please look at https://github.com/wicg/focus-ring/ instead.\n\nArchived content below.\n\n---\n\nBased on a conversation between Alice Boxhall, Brian Kardell and Marcy Sutton, this prototype attaches/manages metadata in the form of a `modality` attribute to the body, as a way to allow authors to experiment with adapting style based on the user's _active_ input modality (i.e., how they are interacting with the UI _right now_).\n\n[Demo](https://alice.github.io/modality/demo)\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere are many instances in which it would be useful for authors to understand the user's current interaction modality and be able to adapt the UI with better accomodations. The motivating example is `:focus` where the status quo is quite problematic:\n\n- The default focus ring is not based on a single :focus rule as some might expect, not all things which can receive focus receive a ring in all cases. Adding such a rule is always currently problematic, but it's also exceptionally common.\n- Many developers disable the default focus ring in their CSS styles, others attempt to style it in concert with their design. The former often seems to be a result of finding the default focus ring both aesthetically unpleasant and confusing to users when applied after a mouse or touch event and introduces accessibility problems.  The latter inevitably creates considerably more of the kind of problem that the former was trying to solve.\n\nTo deal with this:\n- It seems evident that a visual indication of what has focus is only interesting to a user who is using the keyboard to interact with the page. A user using any kind of pointing device would only be interested in what is in focus if they were _just about_ to use the keyboard - otherwise, it is irrelevant and potentially confusing.\n- Thus, if we only show the focus ring when relevant, we can avoid user confusion and avoid creating incentives for developers to disable it.  \n- A mechanism for exposing focus ring styles only when the keyboard is the user's current input modality gives us this opportunity.\n\n## API Proposal\n\n```css\n/* override UA stylesheet if necessary */\n:focus {\n  outline: none;\n}\n\n/* establish desired focus ring appearance for appropriate input modalities */\n:focusring {\n  outline: 2px solid blue;\n}\n```\n\n:focusring matches native elements that are\n1. focussed; and \n2. would display a focus ring if only UA styles applied\n\nAdditionally, :focusring matches non-native elements as if they were\nnative button elements.\n\n## Example heuristic\n\nThe heuristic used to decide the current modality should not be defined\nnormatively. An example heuristic is to update modality on each style recalc:\nif the most recent user interaction was via the keyboard; and less than 100ms\nhas elapsed since the last input event; then the modality is keyboard. Otherwise,\nthe modality is not keyboard.\n\n## Implementation Prototype\n\nThe tiny [keyboard-modality.js](http://alice.github.io/modality/src/keyboard-modality.js) provides a prototype intended to achieve the goals we are proposing with technology that exists today in order for developers to be able to try it out, understand it and provide feedback.  Simply speaking, it sets a `modality=keyboard` attribute on `body` if the script determines that the keyboard is being used. Similarly, the attribute is removed if the script determines that the user is no longer using the keyboard. This allows authors to write rules which consider the input modality and style appropriately. Note that the prototype does not match the proposed API - it is intended to give developers a feel for the model rather than to provide a high-fidelity polyfill.\n\nIt also simulates how the default UA styles would be adjusted by appending the following style as the first rule in the page, which disables the focus ring _unless_ `modality` is set to `keyboard`:\n\n```html\nbody:not([modality=keyboard]) :focus {\n    outline: none;\n}\n```\n\n(This is added in a `<style>` element with the ID `\"disable-focus-ring\"`, to allow easy removal if different behaviour is desired.)\n\n\n### How it works\nThe script uses two heuristics to determine whether the keyboard is being used:\n\n- a `focus` event immediately following a `keydown` event\n- focus moves into an element which requires keyboard interaction, such as a text field\n- _TODO: ideally, we also trigger keyboard modality following a keyboard event which activates an element or causes a mutation; this still needs to be implemented._\n\nCustom elements may use the `supports-modality` attribute to provide a whitelist of supported modalities; any element without this whitelist is considered to support all modalities. Only elements which only support keyboard modality will trigger the `modality=keyboard` attribute on `<body>`.\n"

It's is not a requirement for starting work on a proposal.\n\n**Please [join the WICG](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/) before submitting new proposals.**\n\n 1. **Join the group**: Before bringing the above to the group's attention, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/\">join the community group</a>, which means you agree with the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/\">W3C's Community Contributor License Agreement</a> (CLA). It's critical if you first <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/\">join the group</a> or else key members won't be able to review or discuss your proposal.\n 1. **State the problem, make a rough proposal**: Write an informal description of a limitation with the Web platform and post it to <a href=\"http://discourse.wicg.io/\">Discourse</a>. This should be something you believe is missing in the platform and would make the lives of developers significantly easier if it were added. It can also be something you've noticed is a recurring development pattern which would benefit from standardization. If you have a rough proposal for a solution, spinning up a public GitHub repo from your own account is probably the best way to disseminate it.  It's fine if your proposal is totally rough and informal - include code examples, diagrams, or whatever you think helps explain the problem best.  Be sure to examine use cases.  This can be informally in the Discourse post, or a short document in the repo. Such a document can help prove to the community that there is indeed a need for a solution that needs standardization (see the <a href=\"https://usecases.responsiveimages.org/\">Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Responsive Images</a>, for example).\n 1. **Evaluation**: As a community, we will use Discourse to evaluate interest and ask for potential editors for the proposal.  As soon as sufficient interest is shown in the discourse (notably from potential implementers), the WICG chairs will enable a team of editors to manage the proposal (based on the discourse), and those team members can move ownership of the GitHub repo (if any) to WICG. We will expect all previous contributions to the proposal to have been made by WICG members, or will need explicit CLAs from other contributors - ask the chairs for assistance if needed.  \n 1. **Editing and Refinement**: The community should incubate and refine the proposal, through discussion on GitHub issues on the repo (and Discourse, if appropriate) until they feel the proposal has sufficient support and resolution to move to an appropriate Working Group; at that point, the editing team should contact the chairs, and the chairs will help do an \"<a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/charter-html/request-to-transition.html\">intent to migrate</a>\": where we move the spec to a W3C Working group to seek royalty free licensing commitments from W3C members (you know, the \"free\" in \"free and open\").  As part of that transition, the WICG should seek an FSA commitment from any contributors to the incubation that choose not to join the WG to which it has been transitioned; this will provide the broadest possible IP coverage.\n 1. **(Bonus points) Implementation**: Help turn the ideas from words on paper into working features in modern browsers.\n\n## Becoming a WICG collaborator\nIf you need to be added as a \"collaborator\" on GitHub (to manage a Github repo, be able to close issues, etc), please [open an issue](https://github.com/WICG/admin/issues) in the admin repo asking for permission. One of the Chairs will add you. \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAs a W3C Community Group, the WICG operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\n### Statement of Intent\n\nW3C is committed to maintain a **positive** work environment.

            "text": "# Interventions\n\n## Objective\n\nThe purpose of this github is to create a place to collaborate between browser vendors (and web developers) on various intervention experiments.\n\n## What are interventions?\n\nOver the course of its existence, the web has accumulated a multitude of standards and common patterns. While most of these are beneficial for both developers and users, if abused (intentionally or otherwise) web APIs can sometimes be a detriment to user experience.\n\nAn **intervention** is when a user agent decides to deviate slightly from a standardized behavior in order to provide a greatly enhanced user experience. Because of its nature, it must be done sparingly and with extreme prudence.\n\n## Interventions vs. Other Web Platform Changes\nAn intervention is a specific type of change to the web platform.\n\nAn intervention:\n\n1. Breaks long-standing web behavior in as minimal a way as possible.\n2. Directly benefits the user in a substantial way.\n3. Likely has an opt-out. Will err on the side of giving opt outs, but some rare cases may not need them.\n\n## Proposing an intervention\n\nThis github exists to allow collaborative brainstorming, and to share knowledge about what does and does not work. As such, we encourage everyone to propose interventions that could have big UX impact.\n\nTo propose a new intervention, just create a new github issue. Be sure to include exactly how and when the intervention will occur, and why it is an obvious user benefit.\n\n## Intervention design guidelines\n\nInterventions that are well-designed to balance the concerns of the user with the concerns of the web developer tend to have the following properties:\n\n1. *Predictable*: A developer can anticipate when their code will be impacted by an intervention, and what the resulting behavior will be.\n2. *Avoidable*: Developers following documented best practices shouldn't be impacted by the intervention.\n3. *Transparent*: A developer should be able to tell that an intervention has been hit.  For example, a console message should be generated in the developer tools with a link to details about the intervention and how to avoid it, and some sort of detection or reporting should be available in the wild.\n4. *Justified by data*: As part of designing and shipping an intervention, the browser should collect statistics from the wild that attempt to quantify both the benefit of the intervention and the potential cost in order to help find a good tradeoff.  Once the intervention has shipped, the browser should continue to collect statistics on how often it is triggering and what benefits it's providing.\n\nIn order to design an intervention that meets these properties it's sometimes necessary to first standardize and ship new API surface area.  For example in order to [ignore touch listeners to improve scrolling](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/18) we had to first define an API for [passive event listeners](https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md).\n\n## Discussion of interventions\n\nThere are currently no plans to have in-person meetings about this and discussion should happen primarily via github [issues](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues).  Every intervention which ships in Chrome will have a [discussion thread on blink-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/intervene%7Csort:date) where comments from the public are welcomed.  If you develop a website which you believe is negatively impacted by an intervention in Chrome then please [file a chromium bug](https://crbug.com).  Other questions/concerns can be discussed on [intervention-dev@chromium.org](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/intervention-dev).\n\nFor history and more details on the thinking here within the Chrome team, see:\n- [BlinkOn 7 ecosystem alignment update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W6C3EQFZCahCEBb6lyzrY2WUDuqhqnhhPnZDtOwYw-w)\n- [BlinkOn 6 Interventions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yD5nmmzQGAbV6Zn3aiuEOAFccgbWjXomLCDFM4dYMF4/edit) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQGa_6CRc9I))\n- Original [user-agent intervention proposal](http://bit.ly/user-agent-intervention)\n"

This might take place, for instance, as part of a client-side templating solution or perhaps come to play through the process of rendering user-generated content. The key problem is that it remains difficult to perform these tasks in a safe way. This is specifically the case because the naive approach of joining strings together and stuffing them into an [Element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#element)'s [`innerHTML`](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#widl-Element-innerHTML) is fraught with risks. A very common negative implication concerns the JavaScript execution, which can occur in a number of unexpected ways.\n\nTo address the problem, libraries like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) attempt to carefully manage the inputs and alleviate risks. This is usually accomplished through parsing and sanitizing strings before insertion and takes advantage of a white-list for constructing a DOM and handling its components. This is considerably safer than doing the same on the server-side, yet much untapped potential can still be observed when it comes the client-side sanitization.\n\nAs it stands, every browser has a fairly good idea of when and how it is going to execute code. Capitalizing on this, it is possible to improve the user-space libraries by teaching the browser how to render HTML from an arbitrary string in a safe manner. In other words, we seek to make sure that this happens in a way that is much more likely to be maintained and updated along with the browsers’ ever-changing parser implementations.\n\n## The Proposal\n\nBroadly speaking, the sanitizers already exist as third-party libraries (e.g. DOMPurify, see also the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319071617_DOMPurify_Client-Side_Protection_Against_XSS_and_Markup_Injection)) or in browser-specific and proprietary APIs (e.g. toStaticHTML). The browser-agnostic libraries achieve the goal by relying on the HTML parsing found in-browser, as exposed through [`createHTMLDocument`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMImplementation/createHTMLDocument) or [`DOMParser`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOMParser). Conversely, they still have to work around browser-specific quirks. An API that is built into the browser should be seen as being at the very best place for guaranteeing a properly sanitized markup. \n\n### Two approaches for achieving the desired functionality\n\nWhile the final syntax of the API has not yet been decided on, we suggest two possible approaches for the developers willing to use the browser-embedded sanitizer.\n\n*Option 1. A simple, no-config approach to sanitizing into a secure default quickly and easily.*\n\n```javascript\nlet dirty = user_controlled_html;\nsomeElement.appendChild(sanitize(dirty));\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer would simply pass a string of dirty HTML into the sanitizer and receive the sanitized result as another string. After that, the received string can be safely written into the DOM. The browser would make use of a whitelist by default. This approach is inspired by Microsoft’s toStaticHTML.\n\n*Option 2. A re-usable sanitizer that implements configurable behaviors.*\n\n```javascript\nlet sanitizer = new Sanitizer(options);\nlet dirty = user_controlled_html;\nlet someElement = document.getElementById(...);\nsomeElement.appendChild(sanitizer.sanitize(dirty));\n```\n\nIn this approach, the developer creates an object for the sanitizer and this can be used multiple times with the same developer-provided configuration. It can be approached literally or with a simple use of the browser’s default config. Neither of the two suggestions poses compatibility risks, meaning that they both interoperate nicely with the existing DOM APIs as long as the whitelist is shared among all implementing browsers.\n\n### Browser-Whitelists\n\nTo achieve the goal of a secure sanitization result, the browser needs to use a thoroughly battle-tested whitelist. This doesn’t reinvent the wheel as any given browser already knows the concept of a whitelist in the context of eliminating XSS, for example in, clipboard sanitization, sanitization of Chrome’s context views and similar. The general approach can simply be reused. \n\nWhat is more, the existing JavaScript libraries, such as DOMPurify, also ship well-tested and proven whitelists of elements and attributes that can be allowed by default.\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* Sanitizer Specification 1.0\n  * Supports config-less sanitization;\n  * Supports customization of whitelists for elements and attributes;\n  * The core goal is the sanitization of any markup that can cause XSS.\n\n* Sanitizer Specification 2.0\n  * Supports additional configuration options, possibly stemming from DOMPurify;\n  * Supports custom callbacks and hooks to fine-tune sanitization results.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Who would use this and why?\n* Web application developers who want to allow some - but not all - HTML. This could mean developers handling Wiki pages, message boards, crypto messengers, web mailers, etc. \n* Developers of browser extensions who want to secure their applications against malicious user-controlled, or even site-controlled, HTML.\n* Application developers who create Electron applications and comparable tools which interpret and display HTML and JavaScript.\n\n### Wouldn’t this be just a niche feature?\n* No, according to the statistics offered by the npm.js platform, libraries such as DOMPurify are downloaded over 200 thousand times every month . DOMPurify is furthermore used from within various CDN networks for which no metrics are available at this point.\n* Besides web applications, sanitizer libraries are also used in Electron applications, browser extensions and other applications making use of a browser engine.\n\n### But this can be done on the server, can’t it? Like in the “olden days”.\n* While this is correct, server-side sanitizers have a terrible track record for being bypassed. Using them is conducive to a Denial of Service on the server and one simply cannot know about the browser’s quirks without being highly knowledgeable in this particular realm. \n* As a golden rule, sanitization should happen where the sanitized result is used, so that the above noted knowledge gaps can be mitigated and various risks might be averted.\n\n### What are the key advantages of Sanitizing in the browser?\n* *Minimalistic Approach:* Various libraries, such as DOMPurify, currently need to work around browser-specific quirks. This would no longer matter had the implementations become directly embedded in the browser. \n* *Bandwidth:* Sanitizer libraries are “heavy” and by reducing the need to pull them from a server by embedding them in the browser instead, bandwidth can be saved.\n* *Performance:* Sanitizing markup in C/C++ is faster than doing the same in JavaScript.\n* *Reusability:* Once the browser exposes a sanitizer in the DOM, it can be reused for potentially upcoming [SafeHTML](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2016Jan/0113.html) implementations, [Trusted Types](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types), secure elements and, if configurable, even be repurposed for other changes in the user-controlled HTML, for instance in connection with URL rewriting, removal of annoying UI elements and CSS sanitization.\n\n### What if someone wants to customize the sanitization rules?\n* It should be trivial to implement basic configuration options that allow customization of the default whitelist and enable developers to remove, add or completely rewrite the whitelisted elements and/or attributes. \n* The already mentioned browser's clipboard sanitizer already ships a whitelist, so the only task would be to make it configurable.\n\n### Isn’t building a sanitizer in the browser risky and difficult?\n* No, it may appear so but, in fact, the browsers already feature at least one sanitizer, for instance the one handling HTML clipboard content that is copied and pasted across origins. The existing puzzle pieces only need to be put correctly together in a slightly different way before they are then exposed in the DOM.\n* If there are any risks connected to the new process, then they are not new but rather already concern the handling of the user-generated HTML presently processed by the in-browser sanitizers. Aside for configuration parsing, which should be a trivial problem to solve, no added risks can be envisioned.\n\n### Wait, what does secure even mean in this context?\n* Calling the process secure means that a developer can expect that XSS attacks caused by user-controlled HTML, SVG, and MathML are eradicated. \n* The sanitizer would remove all elements that cause script execution from the string it receives and returns.\n\n"

We're incubating this idea via the WICG in\norder to try to make incremental progress on the long-standing problem of\nexposing features like pinch-zoom to web developers in a rational way.  We are\nworking with the CSSWG to eventually get [these\nideas](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/206) into [the relevant\nspecs](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/505) as first-class features\nof the web platform.\n\n_Update: The `window.visualViewport` API has shipped in Chrome M61 (Sept. 2017). Follow crbug\n[issue 635031](http://crbug.com/635031) for details._\n\n## Draft Spec\n\n[Draft Spec](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/index.html)\n\n## Background\n\nThe mobile web contains two viewports, the Layout and Visual viewport. The\nLayout viewport is what a page lays out its elements into(*) and the Visual\nviewport is what is actually visible on the screen. When the user pinch-zooms\ninto the page, the visual viewport shrinks but the layout viewport is\nunchanged. UI like the on-screen keyboard (OSK) can also shrink the visual\nviewport without affecting the layout viewport. See this\n[demo](http://bokand.github.io/viewport/index.html) to visualize the two\nviewports. This isn't specified anywhere and implementations vary greatly\nbetween browsers.\n\nCurrently, several CSSOM scroll properties are relative to the visual viewport\n(see\n[this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzzvA_AuMDa_nlwIc9PdpzfIXsgrOZDixFvEFwrfXJM/edit#)\nfor list). Again, there is no spec governing this, but this is how browsers\n  have it implemented today. With this implementation, the dimensions of the\n  visual viewport can be easily determined (For example, window.innerHeight =\n  visual viewport height). However, all other coordinates are generally\n  relative to the layout viewport (e.g. getBoundingClientRects,\n  elementFromPoint, event coordinates, etc.). Having these APIs be mixed is\n  arbitrary and confusing.\n\nThis confusion has caused many desktop sites to break when pinch-zoomed or when\nshowing the OSK (see [this bug ](http://crbug.com/489206) for examples). This\nis because mobile browsers added new semantics to existing properties,\nexpecting they'd to be invisible to desktop browsers. This becomes a problem as\nthe lines between mobile and desktop blur and features like on-screen keyboard\nand pinch-zoom make their way to desktops, or when accessing desktop pages from\nmobile devices.\n\n(*) - This isn't strictly true. In Chrome, the layout viewport is actually the\n\"viewport at minimum scale\". While on most well behaving pages this is the box\nthat the page lays out into (i.e. the initial containing block), extra-wide\nelements or an explicit minimum-scale can change this. More specifically, the\nlayout viewport is what position: fixed elements attach to.\n\n## Proposed Plan\n\nWe believe the best way forward is to change those remaining CSSOM scroll\nproperties to be relative to the layout viewport. In fact, Chrome did this in\nM48 but, due to [developer feedback](http://crbug.com/571297), this change was\nreverted in M49. There was more reliance on this than anticipated.\n\nIn order to make this transition we propose adding a new explicit API for the\nvisual viewport. With an explicit API, we could once again change the CSSOM \nscroll properties to be relative to the layout viewport. This change would make\nsure existing desktop sites continue to function correctly as new UI features\nare added. At the same time, it would allow authors to use and customize those\nfeatures where needed.\n\nThe new API is also easy to feature detect and polyfilling this behavior should\nbe fairly straightforward.\n\n## Proposed API (v1)\n\n  * Add a `visualViewport` object on `window`.\n\n```\nvisualViewport = {\n    double offsetLeft; // Relative to the layout viewport\n    double offsetTop; // and read-only.\n\n    double pageLeft;  // Relative to the document\n    double pageTop;  // and read-only.\n\n    double width;  // Read-only and excludes the scrollbars\n    double height; // if present. These values give the number\n                   // of CSS pixels visible in the visual viewport.\n                   // i.e. they shrink as the user zooms in.\n\n    double scale;     // Read-only. The scaling factor applied to\n                      // the visual viewport relative to the `ideal\n                      // viewport` (size at width=device-width). This\n                      // is the same scale as used in the viewport\n                      // <meta> tag.\n}\n```\n\n  * Fire a `scroll` event against `window.visualViewport` whenever the `offsetLeft` or `offsetTop` attributes change.\n\n  * Fire a `resize` event against `window.visualViewport` whenever the `width` or `height` attributes change.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's how an author might use this API to simulate `position: device-fixed`, which fixes elements to the visual viewport.\n\n[Live example from below](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/fixed-to-viewport.html)\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n<style>\n    #layoutViewport {\n        position: fixed;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n        visibility: hidden;\n    }\n    #bottombar {\n        position: fixed;\n        left: 0px;\n        right: 0px;\n        bottom: 0px;\n        background-color: red;\n        transform-origin: left bottom;\n        transform: translate(0px, 0px) scale(1);\n    }\n    #forcescrolling {\n        width: 100px;\n        height: 2000px;\n        background-color: green;\n    }\n</style>\n\n<body>\n    <div id=\"bottombar\">This stays stuck to the visual viewport</div>\n    <div id=\"forcescrolling\"></div>\n    <div id=\"layoutViewport\"></div>\n</body>\n\n<script>\n    var bottomBar = document.getElementById('bottombar');\n    var viewport = window.visualViewport;\n    function viewportHandler() {\n        var layoutViewport = document.getElementById('layoutViewport');\n\n        // Since the bar is position: fixed we need to offset it by the visual\n        // viewport's offset from the layout viewport origin.\n        var offsetLeft = viewport.offsetLeft;\n        var offsetTop = viewport.height\n                    - layoutViewport.getBoundingClientRect().height\n                    + viewport.offsetTop;\n\n        // You could also do this by setting style.left and style.top if you\n        // use width: 100% instead.\n        bottomBar.style.transform = 'translate(' +\n                                    offsetLeft + 'px,' +\n                                    offsetTop + 'px) ' +\n                                    'scale(' + 1/viewport.scale + ')'\n    }\n    window.visualViewport.addEventListener('scroll', viewportHandler);\n    window.visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', viewportHandler);\n</script>\n```\n## Other Examples\n\nHere's a few other examples you can try out on Chrome Canary today. Be sure to turn on the following flags:\n\n  * chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features (Enable window.visualViewport)\n  * chrome://flags/#inert-visual-viewport (Makes window.scrollX|innerWidth and others refer to layout viewport)\n  * chrome://flags/#enable-osk-overscroll (Makes keyboard resize visual viewport only)\n\n### Links\n\n  * [Hide on Zoom](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/hide-on-zoom.html): Overlays a position: fixed\n    box in the viewport (e.g. an ad) but hides to improve the UX when the user zooms in.\n  * [Fixed to keyboard](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/fixed-to-keyboard.html): Keeps a bar (e.g.\n    text formatting toolbar) fixed to the keyboard when it comes up.\n  * [Fixed to keyboard (No Zoom)](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/fixed-to-keyboard-no-zoom.html):\n    Same as above but makes the bar behave like position: fixed rather than position: device-fixed. That is, the\n    bar will stay above the keyboard, but if the user zooms in it will remain in its original position.\n  * [Fixed to viewport](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/fixed-to-viewport.html): Simulates position:\n    device-fixed by keeping a bar fixed to the visual viewport.\n  * [Fixed to viewport (absolute)](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/examples/absolute-fixed-to-viewport.html):\n    Uses position: absolute to accomplish a position: sticky type effect that works with pinch-zoom.\n\n### Polyfill\n\n  TODO: Doesn't work on iOS Safari yet.\n  We've added a rudimentary polyfill that should work across browsers, albeit with worse\n  performance properties (requires polling and ugly hacks). The polyfill itself is\n  [visualViewport.js](https://github.com/WICG/visual-viewport/blob/gh-pages/polyfill/visualViewport.js)\n  and you can see two examples that use it in the same directory:\n\n  * [position: device-fixed with position: fixed](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/polyfill/vvapi-fix.html)\n  * [position: device-fixed with position: absolute](https://wicg.github.io/visual-viewport/polyfill/vvapi-abs.html)\n"

            "text": "This is a proposal for a background-fetching API, to handle large upload/downloads without requiring an origin's clients (pages/workers) to be running throughout the job.\n\n# The problem\n\nA service worker is capable of fetching and caching assets, the size of which is restricted only by [origin storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/#usage-and-quota). However, if the user navigates away from the site or closes the browser, the service worker is likely to be killed. This can happen even if there's a pending promise passed to `extendableEvent.waitUntil` - if it hasn't resolved within a few minutes the browser may consider it an abuse of service worker and kill the process.\n\nThis is excellent for battery and privacy, but it makes it difficult to download and cache large assets such as podcasts and movies, and upload video and images.\n\nThis spec aims to solve the long-running fetch case, without impacting battery life or privacy beyond that of a long-running download.\n\n# Features\n\n* Allow fetches (requests & responses) to continue even if the user closes all windows & workers to the origin.\n* Allow a single job to involve many requests, as defined by the app.\n* Allow the browser/OS to show UI to indicate the progress of that job, and allow the user to pause/abort.\n* Allow the browser/OS to deal with poor connectivity by pausing/resuming the download.\n* Allow the app to react to success/failure of the job, perhaps by caching the results.\n* Allow access to background-fetched resources as they fetch.\n\n# API Design\n\n## Starting a background fetch\n\n```js\nconst registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\nconst bgFetchReg = await registration.backgroundFetch.fetch(id, requests, options);\n```\n\n* `id` - a unique identifier for this background fetch.\n* `requests` - a sequence of URLs or `Request` objects.\n* `options` - an object containing any of:\n  * `icons` - A sequence of icon definitions.\n  * `title` - Something descriptive to show in UI, such as \"Uploading 'Holiday in Rome'\" or \"Downloading 'Catastrophe season 2 episode 1'\".\n  * `downloadTotal` - The total unencoded download size. This allows the UI to tell the user how big the total of the resources is. If omitted, the UI will be in a non-determinate state.\n\n`backgroundFetch.fetch` will reject if:\n\n* The user does not want background downloads, which may be a origin/browser/OS level setting.\n* If there's already a registered background fetch job associated with `registration` identified by `id`.\n* Any of the requests have mode `no-cors`.\n* The browser fails to store the requests and their bodies.\n* `downloadTotal` suggests there isn't enough quota to complete the job.\n\nThe operation will later fail if:\n\n* A fetch with a non-`GET` request fails. There's no HTTP mechanism to resume uploads.\n* Fetch rejects when the user isn't offline. As in, CORS failure, MIX issues, CSP issue etc etc.\n* The unencoded download size exceeds the provided `downloadTotal`.\n* The server provides an unexpected partial response.\n* Quota is exceeded.\n* A response does not have an ok status.\n\nIf `downloadTotal` is exceeded, the operation fails immediately. Otherwise, the other fetches will be given a chance to settle. This means if the user is uploading 100 photos, 99 won't be aborted just because one fails. The operation as a whole will still be considered a failure, but the app can communicate what happened to the user.\n\n`bgFetchReg` has the following:\n\n* `id` - identifier string.\n* `uploadTotal` - total bytes to send.\n* `uploaded` - bytes sent so far.\n* `downloadTotal` - as provided.\n* `downloaded` - bytes stored so far.\n* `result` -  `\"\"`, `\"success\"`, `\"failure\"`.\n* `failureReason` - `\"\"`, `\"aborted\"`, `\"bad-status\"`, `\"fetch-error\"`, `\"quota-exceeded\"`, `\"download-total-exceeded\"`.\n* `recordsAvailable` - Does the underlying request/response data still exist? It's removed once the operation is complete.\n* `activeFetches` - provides access to the in-progress fetches.\n* `onprogress` - Event when the above properties change.\n* `abort()` - abort the whole background fetch job. This returns a promise that resolves with a boolean, which is true if the operation successfully aborted.\n* `match(request, options)` - Access one of the fetch records.\n* `matchAll(request, options)` - Access some of the fetch records.\n\n\n## Getting an instance of a background fetch\n\n```js\nconst registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\nconst bgFetchReg = await registration.backgroundFetch.get(id);\n```\n\nIf no job with the identifier `id` exists, `get` resolves with undefined.\n\n## Getting all background fetches\n\n```js\nconst registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\nconst ids = await registration.backgroundFetch.getIds();\n```\n\n…where `ids` is a sequence of unique identifier strings.\n\n## Background fetch records\n\n```js\nconst bgFetchReg = await registration.backgroundFetch.get(id);\nconst record = bgFetchReg.match(request);\n```\n\n`record` has the following:\n\n* `request`. A Request.\n* `responseReady`. A promise for a Response. This will reject if the fetch fails.\n\n## Reacting to success\n\nFires in the service worker if all responses in a background fetch were successfully & fully read, and all status codes were [ok](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ok-status).\n\n```js\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchsuccess', bgFetchEvent => {\n  // …\n});\n```\n\n`bgFetchEvent` extends [`ExtendableEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#extendableevent), with the following additional members:\n\n* `registration` - The background fetch registration.\n* `updateUI({ title, icons })` - update the UI, eg \"Uploaded 'Holiday in Rome'\", \"Downloaded 'Catastrophe season 2 episode 1'\", or \"Level 5 ready to play!\".\n\nOnce this event is fired, the background fetch job is no longer stored against the registration, so `backgroundFetch.get(bgFetchEvent.id)` will resolve with undefined.\n\nOnce this has completed (including promises passed to `waitUntil`), `recordsAvailable` becomes false, and the requests/responses can no longer be accessed.\n\n## Reacting to failure\n\nAs `backgroundfetchsuccess`, but one or more of the fetches encountered an error.\n\n```js\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchfail', bgFetchEvent => {\n  // …\n});\n```\n\nAside from the event name, the details are the same as `backgroundfetchsuccess`.\n\n## Reacting to abort\n\nIf a background fetch job is aborted, either by the user, or by the developer calling `abort()` on the background fetch job, the following event is fired in the service worker:\n\n```js\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchabort', bgFetchAbortEvent => {\n  // …\n});\n```\n\n`bgFetchAbortEvent` extends [`ExtendableEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#extendableevent), with the following additional members:\n\n* `registration` - The background fetch registration.\n\nThe rest is as `backgroundfetchsuccess`.\n\n## Reacting to click\n\nIf the UI representing a background fetch job is clicked, either during or after the job, the following event is fired in the service worker:\n\n```js\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchclick', bgFetchClickEvent => {\n  // …\n});\n```\n\n* `registration` - The background fetch registration.\n\nSince this is a user interaction event, developers can call `clients.openWindow` in response.\n\nThe rest is as `backgroundfetchsuccess`.\n\n# Possible UI\n\nBackground fetches will be immediately visible using a UI of the browser's choosing. On Android this is likely to be a sticky notification displaying:\n\n* The origin of the site.\n* The chosen icon.\n* The title.\n* A progress bar.\n* Buttons to pause/abort the job.\n* Potentially a way to prevent the origin starting any more background downloads.\n\nIf aborted by the user, the notification is likely to disappear immediately. If aborted via code, the notification will remain in an \"ended\" state.\n\nOnce ended, the progress bar will be replaced with an indication of how much data was transferred. The button to pause/abort the job will no longer be there. The notification will no longer be sticky.\n\nIf the job has ended, clicking the notification may also close/hide it (in addition to firing the event).\n\n# Quota usage\n\nThe background fetch requests & in-progress responses can be accessed at any time until the `backgroundfetchsuccess`, `backgroundfetchfail`, or `backgroundfetchabort` event end, so they count against origin quota.\n\n# Lifecycle\n\nThe background fetch job is linked to the service worker registration. If the service worker is unregistered, background fetches will be aborted (without firing events) and its storage purged.\n\nThis means the feature may be used in \"private browsing modes\" that use a temporary profile, as the fetches will be cancelled and purged along with the service worker registrations.\n\n# Security & privacy\n\n[Some browsers can already start downloads without user interaction](http://output.jsbin.com/fimukur/quiet), but they're easily abortable. We're following the same pattern here.\n\nBackground fetch may happen as the result of other background operations, such as push messages. In this case the background fetch may start in a paused state, effectively asking the user permission to continue.\n\nThe icon and title of the background fetch are controllable by the origin. Hopefully the UI can make clear which parts are under the site's control, and which parts are under the browser's control (origin, data used, abort/pause). There's some prior art here with notifications.\n\nBackground fetches are limited to CORS, to avoid opaque responses taking up origin quota.\n\n# Relation to one-off background sync\n\nBackground-fetch is intended to be very user-visible, via OS-level UI such as a persistent notification, as such background-sync remains a better option for non-massive transfers such as IM messages.\n\n# Examples\n\n## Downloading a movie\n\nMovies are either one large file (+ extra things like metadata and artwork), or 1000s of chunks.\n\nIn the page:\n\n```js\ndownloadButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {\n  try {\n    const movieData = getMovieDataSomehow();\n    const reg = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    const bgFetch = await reg.backgroundFetch.fetch(`movie-${movieData.id}`, movieData.urls, {\n      icons: movieData.icons,\n      title: `Downloading ${movieData.title}`,\n      downloadTotal: movieData.downloadTotal\n    });\n    // Update the UI.\n\n    bgFetch.addEventListener('progress', () => {\n      // Update the UI some more.\n    });\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Display an error to the user\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn the service worker:\n\n```js\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchsuccess', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(async function() {\n    // Copy the fetches into a cache:\n    try {\n      const cache = await caches.open(event.registration.id);\n      const records = await event.registration.matchAll();\n      const promises = records.map(async (record) => {\n        const response = await record.responseReady;\n        await cache.put(record.request, response);\n      });\n      await Promise.all(promises);\n      const movieData = await getMovieDataSomehow(event.registration.id);\n      await event.updateUI({ title: `${movieData.title} downloaded!` });\n    } catch (err) {\n      event.updateUI({ title: `Movie download failed` });\n    }\n  }());\n});\n\n// There's a lot of this that's copied from 'backgroundfetchsuccess', but I've avoided\n// abstracting it for this example.\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchfail', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(async function() {\n    // Store everything successful, maybe we can just refetch the bits that failed\n    try {\n      const cache = await caches.open(event.registration.id);\n      const records = await event.registration.matchAll();\n      const promises = records.map(async (record) => {\n        const response = await record.responseReady.catch(() => undefined);\n        if (response && response.ok) {\n          await cache.put(record.request, response);\n        }\n      });\n      await Promise.all(promises);\n    } finally {\n      const movieData = await getMovieDataSomehow(event.registration.id);\n      await event.updateUI({ title: `${movieData.title} download failed.` });\n    }\n  }());\n});\n\naddEventListener('backgroundfetchclick', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(async function() {\n    const movieData = await getMovieDataSomehow(event.registration.id);\n    clients.openWindow(movieData.pageUrl);\n  }());\n});\n\n// Allow the data to be fetched while it's being downloaded:\naddEventListener('fetch', (event) => {\n  if (isMovieFetch(event)) {\n    event.respondWith(async function() {\n      const cachedResponse = await caches.match(event.request);\n      if (cachedResponse) return cachedResponse;\n\n      // Maybe it's mid-download?\n      const movieData = getMovieDataSomehow(event.request);\n      const bgFetch = await registration.backgroundFetch.get(`movie-${movieData.id}`);\n\n      if (bgFetch) {\n        const record = await bgFetch.match(event.request);\n        if (record) return record.responseReady;\n

A web site must ask the user to reopen a file every time they want to edit it. After opening, the site can only save changes by re downloading the file to the Downloads folder. A native app, by comparison, can maintain a most recently used list, auto save, and save files anywhere the user wants.\n\n## Use cases\n- Open local file to read\n- Open local file to edit and then save\n- Open local file to edit with auto save\n- Create and save a new file\n- Delete an existing file\n- Read meta data about files\n\n## Workarounds\n- [FileSaver.js] polyfills `saveAs()` from the [W3C File API], but files open in a new window instead of downloading on Safari 6.1+ and iOS.\n- In Edge, Firefox, and Chrome developers can:\n\t- Create a fake anchor element (`var a = document.createElement('a')`)\n\t- Set `download` to the desired filename (`a.download = 'file.txt'`)\n\t- Set `href` to a data URI or Blob URL (`a.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob)`)\n\t- Fake a click on the anchor element (`a.click()`)\n\t- Clean up if necessary (`URL.revokeObjectURL(a.href)`)\n- Setting `window.location` to `'data:application/octet-stream' + data_stream`\n- Hidden Flash controls to display a “save as” dialog\n\nThese methods are clunky and only support “save as” (and depending on the UA may automatically appear in Downloads without prompting the user for location). They do not support most recently used lists, auto save, save, or deleting a file.\n"

For proposed solutions, see the [EXPLAINER](EXPLAINER.md).\n\n# Problem\nIn order to minimize the number of DOM elements and improve load times, sites often construct elements as needed and add them to the page. _Hopefully_, this happens just in time for the user to see the element with no delay. In reality, the element trees constructed are quite large/complex, leading to jank.\n\nIt is also common for sites to mutate the DOM in response to user actions or data changes. When applying these changes for large sites, it is difficult to avoid jank.\n\n# Use Cases\nSpeaking with web developers, a few usage requests have been made for an asynchronous rendering API:\n\n- Appending DOM or applying changes from [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) style objects constructed in a worker.\n- Async application of style sheets\n- Applying DOM mutations on the main thread normally, but while remaining responsive to input (i.e. race to finish but interrupt for input)\n\nThere are also several UX patterns that lazily instantiate and append DOM:\n\n- Infinite scrollings lists (news feeds)\n- Side drawers\n- Chat views\n- Image slideshows\n\nAll of these would benefit from an ability to mutate DOM without blocking the main thread.\n\n# Case Study: YouTube Gaming\n[YouTube Gaming](https://gaming.youtube.com/) constructs its comment panel for a video when the user clicks on 'comments', janking the main thread for anywhere from 55-180 ms for rendering (depending on browser). The number gets as high as __500ms__ when including custom element construction.\n\n## [gaming.youtube.com](https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=i0purbwzs4U)\nThe following numbers are ms measurements averaged over 5 times.<br />\n\n__Clicking on 'comments'__\n- Chrome\n  - Style: 65\n  - Layout: 100\n  - Paint: 15  \n- Safari\n  - Layout: 40\n  - Paint: 15\n- Firefox\n  - Layout: 40\n  - Paint: 15\n\n__Scroll to bottom of 'comments'__\n- Chrome\n  - Style: 30\n  - Layout: 15\n  - Paint: 10  \n- Safari\n  - Layout (placeholder images): 25\n  - Paint (placeholder images): 10\n  - Layout (content): 25\n  - Paint (content): 5\n- Firefox\n  - Layout: 15\n  - Paint: 10\n"

            "text": "# Overview\nThe goal of this specification is to allow authors access to the engine's parser.\nThere are two over-arching use cases:\n1. Pass the parser a string receive and receive an object\nto work with instead of building custom parsing in JS.\n2. Extend what the parser understands for fully polyfilling\n\nDesires for these APIs:\n* Build on top of the [TypedOM](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om/) and make modifications to that\n  specification where necessary.\n* Be able to request varying levels of error handling by the parser\n\n## Example: Parsing out a ruleset\n\n```\n   var background = window.cssParse.rule(\"background: green\");\n   console.log(background.styleMap.get(\"background\").value) // \"green\"\n\n   var styles = window.cssParse.ruleSet(\".foo { background: green; margin: 5px; }\");\n   console.log(styles.length) // 5\n   console.log(styles[0].styleMap.get(\"margin-top\").value) // 5\n   console.log(styles[0].styleMap.get(\"margin-top\").type) // \"px\"\n```\n\n## Example: Parsing out a stylesheet\n\n```\n\tconst style = fetch(\"style.css\")\n\t\t.then(response=>CSS.parseStylesheet(response.body));\n\tstyle.then(console.log);\n\n    /* example of the object once we have it more refined */\n    );\n```\n\nUse Cases\n=========\n\n1. Extending CSS in a more intrusive way than our hooks allow - most of the stylesheet is valid CSS, but you want to intercede on the unrecognized things and fix it up into valid CSS.  (Probably don't want to do this - it collides with the custom property/function/at-rule case, but without the friendliness to future language extensions.)\n2. Custom properties that are more complex than we allow you to specify - something that takes \"`<length> || <color>`\", for example. Right now your only choice is to give it the grammar `\"*\"` which just gives you a string that you have to parse yourself.  Similar with custom functions (`--conic-gradient(...)`) and custom at-rules (`@--svg`) - these will *rarely* fit in our limited set of allowed grammars.\n3. CSS-like languages that want to rely on CSS's generic syntax, like CAS or that one mapping language I forget the name of. These have nothing to do with CSS and will likely result in something other than a stylesheet: CAS turns into a series of querySelector() and setAttribute() calls; the mapping thing turns into some data structures specific to that application.\n4. Extending HTML/SVG attributes that use a CSS-like syntax, like `<img sizes>`. If you wanted to add support for the `h` descriptor to `sizes`, you currently have to write your own full-feature CSS parser. (`sizes` is pretty complex; you shouldn't skimp.) Better to let the engine parse it as \"generic CSS\", then you can recognize the parts you need and do image selection yourself.\n\nExample of the problem\n======================\n\nHere is an example of some JS code that is wanting to parse out various CSS\ntypes and also seperate out the values from their units.\n\n```\n\n\t\tfunction parseValues(value,propertyName) {\n\t\t\t// Trim value on the edges\n\t\t\tvalue = value.trim();\n\n\t\t\t// Normalize letter-casing\n\t\t\tvalue = value.toLowerCase();\n\n\t\t\t// Map colors to a standard value (eg: white, blue, yellow)\n\t\t\tif (isKeywordColor(value)) { return \"<color-keyword>\"; }\n\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/[#][0-9a-fA-F]+/g, '#xxyyzz');\n\n\t\t\t// Escapce identifiers containing numbers\n\t\t\tvar numbers = ['ZERO','ONE','TWO','THREE','FOUR','FIVE','SIX','SEVEN','EIGHT','NINE'];\n\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(\n\t\t\t\t/([_a-z][-_a-z]|[_a-df-z])[0-9]+[-_a-z0-9]*/g,\n\t\t\t\ts=>numbers.reduce(\n\t\t\t\t\t(m,nstr,nint)=>m.replace(RegExp(nint,'g'),nstr),\n\t\t\t\t\ts\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t);\n\n\t\t\t// Remove any digits eg: 55px -> px, 1.5 -> 0.0, 1 -> 0\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/(?:[+]|[-]|)(?:(?:[0-9]+)(?:[.][0-9]+|)|(?:[.][0-9]+))(?:[e](?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+))?(%|e[a-z]+|[a-df-z][a-z]*)/g, \"$1\");\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/(?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+)(?:[.][0-9]+)(?:[e](?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+))?/g, \" <float> \");\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/(?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[.][0-9]+)(?:[e](?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+))?/g, \" <float> \");\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/(?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+)(?:[e](?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+))/g, \" <float> \");\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/(?:[+]|[-]|)(?:[0-9]+)/g, \" <int> \");\n\n\t\t\t// Unescapce identifiers containing numbers\n\t\t\tvalue = numbers.reduce(\n\t\t\t\t(m,nstr,nint)=>m.replace(RegExp(nstr,'g'),nint),\n\t\t\t\tvalue\n\t\t\t)\n\n\t\t\t// Remove quotes\n\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/('|‘|’|\")/g, \"\");\n\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\tswitch(propertyName) {\n\t\t\t\tcase 'counter-increment':\n\t\t\t\tcase 'counter-reset':\n\t\t\t\t\t// Anonymize the user identifier\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+/g,' <custom-ident> ');\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t\tcase 'grid':\n\t\t\t\tcase 'grid-template':\n\t\t\t\tcase 'grid-template-rows':\n\t\t\t\tcase 'grid-template-columns':\n\t\t\t\tcase 'grid-template-areas':\n\t\t\t\t\t// Anonymize line names\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/\\[[-_a-zA-Z0-9 ]+\\]/g,' <line-names> ');\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t\tcase '--var':\n\t\t\t\t\t// Replace (...), {...} and [...]\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]*)[)])*[)])*[)])*[)])*[)]/g, \" <parentheses-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]+|[(](?:[^()]*)[)])*[)])*[)])*[)])*[)]/g, \" <parentheses-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]*)\\])*\\])*\\])*\\])*\\]/g, \" <curly-brackets-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]+|\\[(?:[^()]*)\\])*\\])*\\])*\\])*\\]/g, \" <curly-brackets-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]*)\\})*\\})*\\})*\\})*\\}/g, \" <square-brackets-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue = value.replace(/\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]+|\\{(?:[^()]*)\\})*\\})*\\})*\\})*\\}/g, \" <square-brackets-block> \");\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\treturn value.trim();\n\t\t}\n```\n"

This helps ensure the version you're using is stable\nand thoroughly tested._\n\n_If you do want to build from source, make sure you clone the latest tag!_\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Add the script to your page\n\n```html\n    ...\n    <script src=\"/node_modules/wicg-inert/dist/inert.min.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2. Toggle `inert` on an element\n\n```js\nconst el = document.querySelector('#my-element');\nel.inert = true; // alternatively, el.setAttribute('inert', '');\n```\n\n### Legacy Browser Support\n\nIf you want to use `inert` with an older browser you'll need to include\nadditional polyfills for\n[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map),\n[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set),\n[Element.prototype.matches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches),\nand [Node.prototype.contains](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/contains).\n\nIn accordance with the W3C's new [polyfill\nguidance](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/#don-t-serve-unnecessary-polyfills),\nthe `inert` polyfill does not bundle other polyfills.\n\nYou can use a service like [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples)\nto download only the polyfills needed by the current browser. Just add the\nfollowing line to the start of your page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=Map,Set,Element.prototype.matches,Node.prototype.contains\"></script>\n```\n\n### Performance and gotchas\n\nThe polyfill attempts to provide a reasonable fidelity polyfill for the `inert`\n**attribute**, however please note:\n\n- It relies on mutation observers to detect the addition of the `inert`\n  attribute, and to detect dynamically added content within inert subtrees.\n  Testing for _inert_-ness in any way immediately after either type of mutation\n  will therefore give inconsistent results; please allow the current task to end\n  before relying on mutation-related changes to take effect, for example via\n  `setTimeout(fn, 0)` or `Promise.resolve()`.\n\n  Example:\n```js\nconst newButton = document.createElement('button');\nconst inertContainer = document.querySelector('[inert]');\ninertContainer.appendChild(newButton);\n// Wait for the next microtask to allow mutation observers to react to the\n// DOM change\nPromise.resolve().then(() => {\n  expect(isUnfocusable(newButton)).to.equal(true);\n});\n```\n- Using the `inert` **property**, however, is synchronous.\n\n- The polyfill will be expensive, performance-wise, compared to a native `inert`\n  implementation, because it requires a fair amount of tree-walking. To mitigate\n  this, we recommend not using `inert` during performance sensitive actions\n  (like during animations or scrolling). Instead, wait till these events are\n  complete, or consider using\n  [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)\n  to set `inert`.\n\n# Testing\n\nTests are written using ES5 syntax. This is to avoid needing to transpile them\nfor older browsers. There are a few modern features they rely upon, e.g.\n`Array.from` and `Promises`. These are polyfilled for the tests using\n[Polyfill.io](http://polyfill.io/). For a list of polyfilled features, check out\nthe `polyfill` section in `karma.conf.js`.\n\n### Big Thanks\n\nCross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source <3 Provided by [Sauce Labs][homepage]\n\n<a href=\"https://saucelabs.com\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f2cK9ZQ.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n\n[homepage]: https://saucelabs.com\n\n"

            "text": "# Transfer Size Policy\n\n**Goal: enable developers to set and enforce limits on network usage by nested contexts (i.e. iframes).**\n\nToday the top-level frame is unable to audit or enforce size limits on resources used by a nested context. For example, the developer may take great care to optimize their assets to fit within a specific quota, but the moment they add a third party resource that uses (or injects) a nested context, they have no way to track or enforce limits on the resulting size.\n\nIn practice, this can result in mis{behaving, configured} parties fetching large amounts of data, which violate site owners expectations and harm the user experience. To address this, frames could trigger an event once they've consumed at least a specified number of bytes over the network. The page could then handle the event in any way it chooses, such as logging it, displaying a notice to the user, [pausing](https://github.com/jkarlin/pause-frame) it, unloading it, etc. There might even be a future API to cancel all current and future network requests for a frame as a response.\n\nHere is an example which limits an iframe to 300KB total:\n\n```html\n  <script>\n    function onBigFrame(event) {\n      console.log(\"Frame id: \" + event.target.id + \" exceeded its threshold bytes in category: \" + event.category);\n    }\n  </script>\n\n  <iframe id=\"foo\" ontransferexceeded=\"onBigFrame(event)\" transfersize=\"300\" src=\"...\">\n```\n\nHere is an example that limits the total size of the page to 500KB, of which CSS can use 50KB max:\n```\n  <iframe id=\"foo\" ontransferexceeded=\"onBigFrame(event)\" transfersize=\"style:50, total:500\" src=\"...\">\n```\n\nAnd here is an example that only limits the size of videos on the frame to 10MB:\n```\n  <iframe id=\"foo\" ontransferexceeded=\"onBigFrame(event)\" transfersize=\"video:10240\" src=\"...\">\n```\n\nTo see a list of resource types that can be limited, see the Fetch spec's [request-destination](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination) section.\n\nTransfer Size Policy can also be configured via response headers. This is especially useful if third-party script creates the frame such that you can't add the attribute to the frame yourself. In this example, the default threshold for a frame is 100KB, the site's origin is unrestricted, and \\*.example.com is limited to 500KB and 50KB of style:\n\n```http\n  transfersizes: {\"default\":\"100\", \"self\":\"*\", \"*.example.com\":\"style:50, total:500\"}\n```\n\nand in your script:\n```javascript\ndocument.ontransferexceeded=onBigFrame;\n```\n\n\n## Use Cases\n* Enforcing size policies on content, such as AMP's 50,000 byte limit on CSS\n* Logging how often your own site grows larger than desired\n* Monitoring (or even enforcing policy upon) how often ads get too large\n\n## Details\nEach frame with a `transfersize` will count the number of over-the-wire bytes that it and its child frames (transitively) receive from requests that utilize the network (cached responses are not counted). Once a threshold is crossed, the bubbling `transferexceeded` event (a new event type which includes the exceeded threshold and resource category ) is fired on the frame element in the parent frame.\n\nIf any of the network bytes are from origins other than the embedding frame's origin, a random pad is added to `transfersize` so as not to reveal the exact size of the resources in the frame.\n\nThere will be a cap on the number of `transferexceeded` events that will be fired per top-level pageload in order to help [preserve privacy](#Privacy-&-Security).\n\n## Headers and IFrame Attribute Conflict Resolution\nIf both headers a transfersize attribute apply to a frame, the policies are merged such that the most restrictive policy wins.\n\n## Response\nIt is up to the event handler to determine what to do about the frame exceeding its set size. Examples include:\n\n * Logging that the frame exceeded its threshold\n * [Pausing](https://github.com/jkarlin/pause-frame) the frame\n * Unloading the frame\n * Informing the user\n\n## Privacy & Security\nAccording to the [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), it should not be possible to determine the response size of a cross-origin resource. It's impossible for this API to exist and not leak some amount of size information. In particular, it leaks information about the full size of a page. The best we can do is to limit the leak to as small amount as is practically possible. That is what is done for other APIs that leak size information. \n\nThere are two mitigations to help minimize size leakage:\n 1. Frames with network responses that are cross-origin with respect to the embedding page have a random amount of bytes added to that component of their `transfersize`. The developer can be certain that the `transferexceeded` event will only fire if at least the threshold bytes were observed, but it may have been even more in a cross-origin situation.\n 1. There is a cap on the number of `transferexceeded` events that can be fired per top-level page load to stop adversaries from taking lots of samples in order to statistically defeat the random padding. (e.g., 10-100)\n \nSpecifics about the random pad distribution and the size of the event cap will be provided in the specification.\n\n---\n\n- Discuss: https://github.com/WICG/content-size/issues\n"

Sometimes these headers add significant number of\n  bytes, e.g. CSP.\n\n**Problem 2:** Some HTTP headers are sent with every response even though their\n  effect has a lifetime, e.g. HSTS. Within the valid time frame these headers\n  do not need to be repeated.\n\n**Goal:** Mechanism to download configurations like HTTP header values only\n  once. These values are only overridden when needed.\n\n### Missing configurations\n**Problem:** For complex web applications it is easy to forget configuring\n  certain resources or pages, e.g. the error page.\n\n**Goal 1:** Fallback settings that are applied when HTTP headers are not set.\n\n**Goal 2:** Baseline settings that guaranteed to be applied, e.g. baseline CSP\n  which guarantees a certain least level of security for the entire origin.\n\n### CORS-preflight overhead\n**Problem:** For certain resources the CORS-preflight decisions can be\n  pre-determined. That is, the server decision to (dis-)allow access is\n  independent of the actual request itself but static for certain requests, e.g.\n  \"allow all requests from a.com\".\n\n**Goal:** Mechanism to inform a browser about CORS access decisions beforehand\n  to avoid CORS-preflight request overhead.\n\n\n## The Proposal\nWe propose Origin Manifest as a web platform mechanism that aims to shift\nconfiguring the origin from web applications to the origin itself.\n\n### Server side\nOrigin Manifest files are to be published in a well-known location on the\nserver. This enforces that the origin and not the individual web apps defines\nthem.\n\n### Client side\nWeb clients fetch and cache manifests for an origin. There can always be at most\none manifest for an origin. The client enforces the configurations from a\nmanifest similar to how HTTP headers are used. In fact, currently most\nconfigurations directly relate to HTTP headers, e.g. CSP.\n\n### Origin Manifest File\n\n#### File Format\nOrigin Manifests must be written in valid JSON format. The currently discussed\nschema will look like or similar to the one propsed by Mike West in\nhttps://github.com/WICG/origin-policy/issues/19#issuecomment-321229817.\n\n#### Versioning\nUpdates to the Origin Manifest file are natural. To this end every manifest has\na by the server defined version identifier. This allows firstly to easily\nidentify if a client needs to fetch a newer version. Secondly, it allows a web\napplication to decide that a manifest cached in the client is \"good enough\" to\navoid fetching a newer version for performance reasons.\n\n\n### Fetching Protocol\nClients always set the `Sec-Origin-Manifest` header to indicate the support for\nthe mechanism. Servers can then opt-in to use the mechanism by sending back a\n`Sec-Origin-Manifest` header with the current manifest version. If servers\nshould decide to not send the header, clients try to retreive a manifest from\ntheir cache and not use Origin Manifest otherwise.\n\n#### Opt-in\nIn case no manifest is cached the client indicates support for the feature by\nsetting the value 1.\n![Opt-in](/images/opt_in.png)\n\n#### Updating and Confirming\nIn case a manifest is cached the client informs the server about the currently\ncached version. If the version is accepted by the server the response simply\nconfirms the header. No fetch is needed. Otherwise the new version is fetched.\n![Updating and Confirm](/images/update.png)\n\n#### Opt-out\nServers can decide not no longer use Origin Manifest. If so they can set the\n`Sec-Origin-Manifest` header to 0 in the response. Clients then behave like no\nmanifest was ever set and remove the currently cached manifest from cache (if\nany).\n\n## Related Work\nMark Nottingham came up with basically the same idea around the same time\nhttps://mnot.github.io/I-D/site-wide-headers/.\nThe goal is of course to pick the best parts from both approaches and to merge\nthem into a useful mechanism.\n\n\n## Discussion\n**Why is the current version sent?**\n\nThe currently cached version is set in the request header to allow HTTP2 Push.\nIn particular, the server can decide to push the manifest since it knows whether\nit will be eventually fetched or not.\n\n\n**Why does it defer the response?**\n\nCertain configuration options, e.g. CSP, require to be loaded before the actual\ncontent is processed, e.g. a HTML document is rendered. This makes it also\nfundamentally different from Application Manifest\n(https://w3c.github.io/manifest/).\n\n\n**Why not just using HTTP caching and ETag?**\n\nWe need to process Origin Manifests differently from other data fetched over\nHTTP. In particular, it allows us to manage the different versions and to ensure\nthat there exists at most only exactly one manifest per origin.\nAlso, directly related to the above question \"Why is the current version sent?\",\nwe need to store and notify the current version or servers using HTTP/2 would\nstart pushing the manifest to the client which clients would need to cancel.\nThis imposes performance costs we want to avoid.\n"

            "text": "\n# Shape Detection API Specification _:stars:_:movie_camera:\n\nThis is the repository for `shape-detection-api`, an experimental API for detecting Shapes (e.g. Faces, Barcodes, Text) in live or still images on the Web by **using accelerated hardware/OS resources**.\n\nYou're welcome to contribute! Let's make the Web rock our socks off!\n\n## [Introduction](https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/#introduction) :blue_book:\n\nPhotos and images constitute the largest chunk of the Web, and many include recognisable features, such as human faces, text or QR codes. Detecting these features is computationally expensive, but would lead to interesting use cases e.g. face tagging or detection of high saliency areas. Users interacting with WebCams or other Video Capture Devices have become accustomed to camera-like features such as the ability to focus directly on human faces on the screen of their devices. This is particularly true in the case of mobile devices, where hardware manufacturers have long been supporting these features. Unfortunately, Web Apps do not yet have access to these hardware capabilities, which makes the use of computationally demanding libraries necessary.\n\n## Use cases :camera:\n\nQR/barcode/text detection can be used for:\n* user identification/registration, e.g. for [voting purposes](https://twitter.com/RegistertoVote/status/733123511128981508);\n* eCommerce, e.g. [Walmart Pay](https://www.slashgear.com/awalmart-announces-walmart-pay-for-qr-code-based-mobile-payments-10417912/);\n* Augmented Reality overlay, e.g. [here](http://www.multidots.com/augmented-reality/);\n* Driving online-to-offline engagement, fighting fakes [etc](https://www.clickz.com/why-have-qr-codes-taken-off-in-china/23662/).\n\nFace detection can be used for:\n* producing fun effects, e.g. [Snapchat Lenses](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/lenses1);\n* giving hints to encoders or auto focus routines;\n* user name tagging;\n* enhance accesibility by e.g. making objects appear larger as the user gets closer like [HeadTrackr](https://www.auduno.com/headtrackr/examples/targets.html);\n* speeding up Face Recognition by indicating the areas of the image where faces are present.\n\n\n## Current Related Efforts and Workarounds :wrench:\n\nSome Web Apps -gasp- run Detection in Javascript. A performance comparison of some such libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect#performance) (note that this performance evaluation does not include e.g. WebCam image acquisition and/or canvas interactions).\n\nSamsung Browser [has a private API](developer.samsung.com/internet) (click to unfold \"Overview for Android\", then search for \"QR code reader\").\n\n**TODO**: compare a few JS/native libraries in terms of size and performance. On that, `zxingjs2` has [a list of alternative JS libraries](https://github.com/ghybs/zxingjs2#other-barcode-image-processing-libraries-related-to-javascript).\n\nAndroid Native Apps usually integrate [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) (which amounts to adding ~560KB when counting [core.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/zxing/core/3.3.0/), [android-core.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/zxing/android-core/3.3.0/) and [android-integration.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/zxing/android-integration/3.3.0/))).\n\nOCR reader in Javascript are north of 1MB of size ()\n\n## Potential for misuse :money_with_wings:\n\nFace Detection is an expensive operation due to the algorithmic complexity. Many requests, or demanding systems like a live stream feed with a certain frame rate, could slow down the whole system or greatly increase power consumption.\n\n## Platform specific implementation notes :computer:\n\n## Overview\n\nWhat platforms support what detector?\n\nEncoder   | Mac| Android | Win10  | Linux   | ChromeOs |\n--------- |:--:| :------:| :---:  | :------:| :------: |\nFace      | sw | hw/sw   | sw     | &#10008;| &#10008; |\nQR/Barcode| sw | sw      |&#10008;| &#10008;| &#10008; |\nText      | sw | sw      | sw     | &#10008;| &#10008; |\n\n\n### Android\n\nAndroid provides both a stand alone software face detector and a interface to the hardware ones.\n\n| API           |     uses...     | Release notes  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| [FaceDetector](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/FaceDetector.html)| Software based using the [Neven face detector](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/neven)| API Level 1, 2008|\n| [Vision.Face](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/vision/face/Face)| Software based | Google Play services 7.2, Aug 2015|\n| [Camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CaptureRequest.html#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE)| Hardware | API Level 21/Lollipop, 2014 |\n| [Camera.Face](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Face.html) (old)| Hardware | API Level 14/Ice Cream Sandwich, 2011 |\n\nThe availability of the actual hardware detection depends on the actual chip; according to the market share in [1H 2016](http://www.antutu.com/en/view.shtml?id=8256) Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung and HiSilicon are the largest individual OEMs and they all have support for Face Detection (all the top-10 phones are covered as well):\n* [Qualcomm Snapdragon](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/snapdragon-sdk-android/facial-recognition) chipset family supports it since ~2013 as part of their ISP.\n* MediaTek as part of [CorePilot 2.0](http://cdn-cw.mediatek.com/White%20Papers/MediaTek_CorePilot%202.0_Final.pdf) (introduced in 2015).\n* [Samsung Exynos](http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/data/Benefits_of_Exynos_5420_ISP_for_Enhanced_Imaging_Experience.pdf) (at least 2013).\n* Huawei HiSilicon [Kirin950](http://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-hisilicon-kirin-950-official-653811) since 2015 (this fabless manufacturer is relatively new).\n* It is worth noting that ARM [acquired Apical in 2016](https://www.arm.com/products/graphics-and-multimedia/computer-vision) for its computer vision expertise.\n\nBarcode/QR and Text detection is available via Google Play Services [barcode](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/vision/barcode/package-summary) and [text](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/vision/text/package-summary), respectively.\n\n### Mac OS X / iOS\n\nMac OS X/iOS provides `CIDetector` and `Vision Framework` for Face, QR, Text and Rectangle detection in software or hardware.\n\n| API           |     uses...     | Release notes  |\n| ------------- |:-------------: | -----:|\n| [Vision Framework, Mac OS X](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)| Software and Hardware | OS X v10.13, 2017 |\n| [Vision Framework, iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)| Software and Hardware | IOS X v11.0, 2017 |\n| [CIDetector, Mac OS X](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreImage/Reference/CIDetector_Ref/)| Software | OS X v10.7, 2011 |\n| [CIDetector, iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreImage/Reference/CIDetector_Ref/) | Software | iOS v5.0, 2011 |\n| [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avcapturemetadataoutput?language=objc)| Hardware | iOS 6.0, 2012 |\n\nApple has supported Face Detection in hardware since the [Apple A5 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A5) introduced in 2011.\n\n### Windows\n\nWindows 10 has a [FaceDetector](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974129) class and support for Text Detection [OCR](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.ocr.aspx).\n\n## Rendered URL :bookmark_tabs:\n\nThe rendered version of this site can be found in https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api (if that's not alive for some reason try the [rawgit rendering](https://rawgit.com/WICG/shape-detection-api/gh-pages/index.html)).\n\n## Examples and demos\n\nhttps://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/#examples\n\n## Notes on bikeshedding :bicyclist:\n\nTo compile, run:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ -F file=@index.bs -F force=1 > index.html\n```\n\nif the produced file has a strange size (i.e. zero), then something went terribly wrong; run instead\n\n```\ncurl https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ -F file=@index.bs -F output=err\n```\nand try to figure out why `bikeshed` did not like the `.bs` :'(\n"

            "text": "# Media Capabilities API\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nTo deliver media across an enormous range of devices and networks, modern services stream their content in a wide range of formats - varying by codec, resolution, container format, encryption scheme, and other dimensions.  Unlike many devices, browsers run across a wide range of platforms and hardware, so identifying which formats are optimal - or even supported - is challenging.  Existing Web APIs, like [isTypeSupported](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/#dom-mediasource-istypesupported) and [canPlayType](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#dom-navigator-canplaytype) are vague and insufficiently expressive; thus sites often pick an arbitrary target independent of actual capabilities.\n\n## Main Requirements\n\nThe Media Capabilities API seeks to provide definitive answers on several playback dimensions:\n\n*   Given its properties, can a specified piece of media content be played at all?\n*   Will playback have high quality (smoothness)?  Will it be power efficient?\n*   Do output capabilities (e.g. color gamut, dynamic range, audio channels) match content?\n*   Are security requirements (e.g. encryption, HDCP, etc) supported or playback-impacting?\n*   Given multiple possible media formats, which is preferable?\n\nThe sum of these requirements is simple; given the reality that content items are stored in multiple formats and levels, which of these should be selected for delivery to a particular UA?\n\n## Solution Outline\n\nThe proposed solution is to introduce a new API and corresponding set of properties that meet the requirements above:\n\n*   A new query-based capability API allows pages to identify whether a given combination of properties - codec and profile, resolution, frame/sample rate, bit rate, bit depth, pixel format, color space, EOTF, content protection scheme, and others - is supported.  If so, estimates of playback quality and power efficiency will also be provided.  This mostly corresponds to the decoding capability of the UA.\n\n*   Additional output properties (e.g. on window.screen), such as color gamut and dynamic range, will identify what can meaningfully be rendered to the user.  This helps sites avoid resource-intensive formats that can be decoded but not properly displayed (e.g. HDR content on a SDR display, or multichannel audio with stereo speakers).\n\n*   Even with the above, existing APIs and heuristics remain important.  Network and CDN throughput aren’t addressed by the above but often constrain viable bitrates.  Real-time contention for CPU/GPU, detected using dropped frame count or perhaps the new [Media Playback Quality](https://wicg.github.io/media-playback-quality/) API, may also dynamically limit quality (e.g. forcing lower resolution).\n\nThe above allows sites to make optimal decisions, most of the time, before streaming begins.\n"

These\nspecifications replace the ~~[W3C TAG's Web Packaging\nDraft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/)~~ and will allow people\nto bundle together the resources that make up a website, so they can be shared\noffline, either with or without a proof that they came from the original\nwebsite. A full list of use cases and resulting requirements is available in\n[draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases.html)\n([IETF\ndraft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases)).\nThe [explainer](explainer.md) walks through how to use these specs to\nachieve the use cases.\n\nThe specifications come in several layers:\n\n1. [Signed HTTP exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html)\n   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses)):\n   These allow a browser to trust that a single HTTP request/response pair was\n   generated by the origin it claims.\n   * As we implement and test signed exchanges, we're publishing periodic\n     snapshots so that browsers, publishers, and intermediates can synchronize\n     on the same format. The [current implementation snapshot\n     ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl)\n     is an Internet Draft, and a [draft of the next\n     snapshot](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl.html)\n     is in this repository.\n1. [Bundled HTTP exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html)\n   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges)):\n   A collection of exchanges, each of which could be signed or unsigned, with\n   some metadata describing how to interpret the bundle as a whole. This\n   specification has an initial draft in a PR, but isn't finished yet. This work\n   may proceed through either the IETF or the W3C/WHATWG.\n1. [Loading](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/loading.html): A description of\n   how browsers load signed and bundled exchanges. This is initially specified\n   here, and will eventually merge into the appropriate specs, e.g.\n   [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), that live in either the W3C or\n   WHATWG. Currently this only covers signed exchanges.\n\nA previous draft of the format combined layers 1 and 2 into a single format for\nsigned packages:\n[draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html)\n([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging)).\nThe DISPATCH WG at IETF99\n[recommended](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-99-dispatch/) the current\nsplit.\n\n## Building this repository\n\n### Building the Draft\n\nFormatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.\n\n```sh\n$ make\n```\n\nThis requires that you have software installed as described in\nhttps://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md.\n\n### Packaging tool.\n\nInstall this with `go install github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/signedexchange/cmd/gen-signedexchange`.\n\nSee [go/signedexchange](go/signedexchange) for the usage of the tool.\n"

            "text": "# Controls List API\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Web platform offers two solutions for websites with regards to media controls:\n* use the browser provided ones (aka. native controls) without any control of the available features, user experience or UI;\n* implement custom controls which creates complexity, maintainance burden and isn't future forward.\n\nThis situation pushes websites to extreme: they have to either not care about their media controls experience or have to fully commit to it. This lack of middle ground pushes websites to use custom controls as soon as they have one need that isn't compatible with the default browser experience. This is harming the ecosystem because custom controls can often offer lower quality implementation and prevents the browser from creating a homogenious experience for its users or integrate new system features into the website controls.\n\n# Main Requirements\n\nThis API is intended to help solve part of this problem by providing a solution for websites not interested to implement their own media controls but still interested to tailor the experience for their users. It will not offer an API for websites to customise the look and feel of the control but will allow them to pick which components of the controls should be available to the users.\n\n## Solution outline\n\nThe solution is described in details in the [explainer](explainer.md).\n\nIt is introducing a new attribute, `controlslist` that allows websites to blacklist or whitelist controls that should appear. The solution is meant to be incremental and start by only blacklisting of a few components and add more as requirements emerge.\n\n## Proposed spec change\n\nThere's a [pull request](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/2426) to the WHATWG HTML spec and the [build](https://wicg.github.io/controls-list/html-output/multipage/embedded-content.html#attr-media-controlslist) of the spec with the change.\n"

This helps ensure the version you're using is stable\nand thoroughly tested._\n\n_If you do want to build from source, make sure you clone the latest tag!_\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Add the script to your page\n\n```html\n    ...\n    <script src=\"/node_modules/focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2. Update your CSS\n\nWe suggest that users\nselectively disable the default focus style\nby selecting for the case when the polyfill is loaded\nand `.focus-visible` is _not_ applied to the element:\n\n```css\n/*\n  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the mouse,\n  but it will still show up on keyboard focus.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\nIf there are elements which should always have a focus ring shown,\nauthors may explicitly add the `focus-visible` class.\nIf explicitly added, it will not be removed on `blur`.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using a framework which overwrites your classes ([#179](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible/issues/179)),\nyou can rely on the `data-focus-visible-added` attribute.\n```css\n.js-focus-visible :focus:not([data-focus-visible-added]) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe script uses two heuristics to determine whether the keyboard is being used:\n\n- a `focus` event immediately following a `keydown` event where the key pressed was either `Tab`,\n`Shift + Tab`, or an arrow key.\n- focus moves into an element which requires keyboard interaction,\n  such as a text field\n- _TODO: ideally, we also trigger keyboard modality\n  following a keyboard event which activates an element or causes a mutation;\n  this still needs to be implemented._\n\n### Dependencies\n\nIf you want to use `:focus-visible` with an older browser you'll need to include an additional polyfill for [`Element.prototype.classList`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist).\n\nIn accordance with the W3C's new [polyfill\nguidance](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/#don-t-serve-unnecessary-polyfills), the\n`:focus-visible` polyfill does not bundle other polyfills.\n\nYou can use a service like [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) to download only the polyfills needed by the current browser. Just add the following line to the start of your page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=Element.prototype.classList\"></script>\n```\n\n# Backwards compatibility\nUntil all browsers ship `:focus-visible` developers will need to use it defensively to avoid accidentally\nremoving focus styles in legacy browsers. This is easy to do with the polyfill.\n\n```css\n/*\n  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the mouse,\n  but it will still show up on keyboard focus.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n\n/*\n  Optionally: Define a strong focus indicator for keyboard focus.\n  If you choose to skip this step then the browser's default focus\n  indicator will be displayed instead.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible .focus-visible {\n  …\n}\n```\n\nAs [explained by the Paciello Group](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/03/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/), developers who don't use the polyfill can still defensively rely on `:focus-visible` using the\nfollowing snippet:\n\n```css\n/*\n  Provide basic, default focus styles.\n*/\nbutton:focus {\n  …\n}\n\n/*\n  Remove default focus styles for mouse users ONLY if\n  :focus-visible is supported on this platform.\n*/\nbutton:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\n  …\n}\n\n/*\n  Optionally: If :focus-visible is supported on this\n  platform, provide enhanced focus styles for keyboard\n  focus.\n*/\nbutton:focus-visible {\n  …\n}\n```\n\nIn the future, when all browsers support `:focus-visible`, the\nsnippets above will be unnecessary. But until that time it's important\nto be mindful when you use `:focus-visible` and to ensure you always\nhave a fallback strategy.\n\n### Big Thanks\n\nCross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source <3 Provided by [Sauce Labs][homepage]\n\n<a href=\"https://saucelabs.com\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f2cK9ZQ.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n\n[homepage]: https://saucelabs.com\n"

            "text": "## Custom Performance Entries Explainer\n\n# *Deprecated in favor of L3 proposal discussed [here](https://github.com/w3c/user-timing/issues/43).*\n\n[PerformanceObserver](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#the-performanceobserver-interface) provides a consistent way for the browser to expose performance information to web developers and analytics packages in the wild. However, there are times when web developers have performance insights they’d like to process alongside the information the browser provides. Web developers should be able to communicate their own information to performance observers, with rich annotation, enabling their centralized performance monitoring logic and third party analytics tooling to integrate data from the browser with insights from the web page.\n\n## Mark and Measure\n\n`performance.mark` and `performance.measure` enable adding some custom information to the performance timeline, but don’t allow associating rich annotations with these entries. These annotations are required for developers to understand the context of performance critical events. Mark and measure also don’t allow using arbitrary timestamps, such as timestamps obtained from events, other performance entries, etc.\n\n## API\n\nA polyfill of the proposed API can be found [here](https://github.com/tdresser/custom-performance-entry).\n\nWe propose adding a new method performance.queueEntry, which queues a CustomPerformanceEntry with entryType \"custom\". The `name`, `startTime`, `duration` and `detail` fields are used to populate the `CustomPerformanceEntry`. `detail` is an additional field on `CustomPerformanceEntry`, which is an unstructured object, analogous to the `detail` field of [`CustomEvent`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-customevent).\n\n```javascript\ninterface CustomPerformanceEntry : PerformanceEntry {\n    readonly attribute any detail;\n};\n\ndictionary PerformanceEntryInit {\n    DOMString name,\n    DOMHighResTimeStamp startTime,\n    DOMHighResTimeStamp duration,\n    any detail\n}\n\npartial interface Performance {\n    void queueEntry(PerformanceEntryInit performanceEntryInit);\n};\n\n```\n\n\n## Buffering\n\nThese events will be buffered until the end of onload, up to 100 events of entryType \"custom\". This is the default for entryTypes in general.\n\n## Explicit vs Implicit timestamps\n\nThe proposed API always requires passing timestamps for the current time and duration, instead of using the current time, like mark & measure. In some cases, this increases the complexity of the API a bit.\n\nHowever, there are cases where passing timestamps explicitly is required. For example, consider the case of measuring the time from navigationStart until the page is \"interactive\", our “[Time to Consistently Interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/consistently-interactive)” metric. In this case, we need to measure a series of timestamps, which are candidates for TTI, but only actually dispatch one of them, several seconds after the fact. This requires explicit timestamps.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThis example records the time between first contentful paint, and the first touch input. It includes the id of the element touched.\n\n```javascript\nlet firstTouchStartTime = null;\nlet firstTouchStartTargetId = null;\nlet firstContentfulPaintTime = null;\n\nfunction dispatchPaintToInputIfAvailable() {\n  if (firstTouchStartTime == null || firstContentfulPaintTime == null)\n    return;\n  performance.queueEntry({\n    \"first-contentful-paint-to-touch-start\",\n    startTime: firstContentfulPaintTime,\n    duration: firstTouchStartTime - firstContentfulPaintTime,\n    detail: {id: firstTouchStartTargetId},\n  });\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {\n  firstTouchStartTime = e.timeStamp;\n  firstTouchStartTargetId = e.target ? e.target.id : null;\n  dispatchPaintToInputIfAvailable();\n}, {once:true, passive:true})\n\nconst observer = new PerformanceObserver((entries) => {\n  for (const entry of entries.getEntries()) {\n    if (entry.name != \"first-contentful-paint\")\n      continue;\n    firstContentfulPaintTime = entry.startTime;\n    dispatchPaintToInputIfAvailable();\n  }\n});\n\nobserver.observe({entryTypes:['paint']})\n```\n\n### Implementing mark & measure with this API\n`performance.mark` and `performance.measure` can be redefined in terms of this API.\n\n```javascript\nconst lastMarkTimes = new Map();\n\nperformance.mark = function(name) {\n  const now = performance.now();\n  lastMarkTimes.set(name, now);\n  performance.queueEntry({\n    name,\n    startTime: now,\n    duration: 0,\n  });\n}\n\nperformance.measure = function(name, startmark, endmark) {\n  performance.queueEntry({\n    name,\n    startTime: lastMarkTimes.get(startMark),\n    duration: lastMarkTimes.get(endMark) - lastMarkTimes.get(startMark),\n  });\n}\n```\n"

            "text": "# Event Timing Web Perf API\n\nMonitoring event latency today requires an event listener. This precludes measuring event latency early in page load, and adds unnecessary performance overhead.\n\nThis document provides a proposal for giving developers insight into the latency of a subset of events triggered by user interaction.\n\n## Minimal Proposal\n\nWe propose exposing performance information for events of the following types when they take longer than 50ms from timestamp to the next paint.\n* MouseEvents\n* PointerEvents\n* TouchEvents\n* KeyboardEvents\n* WheelEvents\n* InputEvents\n* CompositionEvents\n\nThis proposal defines an API addressing the following use cases:\n\n1.  Observe the queueing delay of input events before performance observers are registered.\n2.  Measure combined event handler duration, including browser event handling logic.\n\nSee more specific use cases [here](#specific-use-cases).\n\nA polyfill approximately implementing this API can be found [here](https://github.com/tdresser/input-latency-web-perf-polyfill/tree/gh-pages).\n\nOnly knowing about slow events doesn't provide enough context to determine if a site is getting better or worse. If a site change results in more engaged users, and the fraction of slow events remains constant, we expect an increase in the number of slow events. We also need to enable computing the fraction of events which are slow to avoid conflating changes in event frequency with changes in event latency.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we introduce:\n\n```js\ninterface PerformanceEventTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n    // The type of event dispatched. E.g. \"touchmove\".\n    // Doesn't require an event listener of this type to be registered.\n    readonly attribute DOMString name;\n    // \"event\".\n    readonly attribute DOMString entryType;\n    // The event timestamp.\n    readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp startTime;\n    // The time the first event handler started to execute.\n    // |startTime| if no event handlers executed.\n    readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp processingStart;\n    // The time the last event handler finished executing.\n    // |startTime| if no event handlers executed.\n    readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp processingEnd;    \n    // The duration between |startTime| and the next time we \"update the rendering \n    // or user interface of that Document and its browsing context to reflect the \n    // current state\" in step 7.12 in the HTML event loop processing model.\n    readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp duration;\n    // Whether or not the event was cancelable.\n    readonly attribute boolean cancelable;\n};\n\n// Contains the number of events which have been dispatched, per event type.\ninterface EventCounts {\n  readonly attribute unsigned long click;\n  ...\n  readonly attribute unsigned long touchmove;\n  ...\n};\n\npartial interface Performance {\n    // Contains the number of events which have been dispatched, per event type. Populated asynchronously. \n    readonly attribute EventCounts eventCounts;\n};\n```\n\n### Security and Privacy\nTo avoid adding another high resolution timer to the platform, `duration` is rounded to the nearest multiple of 8. Event handler duration inherits it's precision from `performance.now()`, and could previously be measured by overriding addEventListener, as demonstrated in the polyfill.\n\n### Usage\n```javascript\nconst performanceObserver = new PerformanceObserver((entries) => {\n  for (const entry of entries.getEntries()) {\n      console.log(entry);\n  }\n});\n\nperformanceObserver.observe({entryTypes:['event']});\n```\n\n## First Input Timing\nThe very first user interaction has a disproportionate impact on user experience, and is often disproportionately slow. In Chrome, the 99'th percentile of the `entry.processingStart` - `entry.startTime` for the following events is over 1 second:\n* Key down\n* Mouse down\n* Pointer down which is followed by a pointer up\n* Click\n\nThis is ~4x the 99'th percentile of these events overall. In the median, we see ~10ms for the first event, and ~2.5ms for subsequent events.\n\nThis list intentionally excludes scrolls, which are often not blocked on javascript execution.\n\nIn order to address capture user pain caused by slow initial interactions, we propose always reporting first input timing within the event timing API specific to this use-case.\n      \nFirstInputDelay can be polyfilled today: see [here](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/first-input-delay) for an example. However, this requires registering analytics JS before any events are processed, which is often not possible. First Input Delay can also be polyfilled on top of the event timing API, but it isn't very ergonomic, and due to the asynchrony of `performance.eventCounts` can sometimes incorrectly report an event as the first event when there was a prior event less than 50ms.\n\n## Specific Use Cases\n* Clicking a button changes the sorting order on a table. Measure how long it takes from the click until we display reordered content.\n* A user drags a slider to control volume. Measure the latency to drag the slider. \n  * Note that part of the latency may come from event handlers, but a site may choose to coalesce input during the frame, and respond to it during rAF.\n* Hovering a menu item triggers a flyout menu. Measure the latency for the flyout to appear.\n* Approximate the 75'th percentile of click event queueing times. An approximation can be achieved by assuming that all events that aren't slow have a queueing time of 0.\n"

            "text": "# Lifecycle API for Web Pages\nLink to spec: https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/spec.html\n\n## Motivation\nFor detailed motivation see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.ejq0luje6eyb).\n\nWith large numbers of web apps (and tabs) running, critical resources such as memory, CPU, battery, network etc easily get oversubscribed, leading to a bad end user experience.\nApplication lifecycle is a key way that modern OS' manage resources. On Android, iOS and also more recent Windows versions, apps can be started and stopped at will by the platform. This lets the platform streamline and re-allocate resources where they best benefit the user.\n\nOn the web, we’ve tackled this with one-off features eg. reactive tab-discarding in extreme memory pressure - which can break websites.\nWhile this is okay in the short term, in the long term it is important to incorporate first class support in the web platform, create the right incentive structure for web developers, and allow the system to proactively reallocate resources and avoid getting into extreme resource situations.\n\nFor a platform to support application lifecycle, it needs to both:\n* provide developers with signals about transitions between the lifecycle states\n* provide lifecycle-compatible APIs that allow key capabilities to work even when the app is backgrounded or stopped.\n\nThe web ecosystem lacks a clear lifecycle. This proposal attempts to define what the lifecycle of a web page is and add necessary extensions to enable supporting two important system interventions necessary for resource re-allocation:\n* Tab discarding for memory saving\n* CPU stopping for battery saving\n\nWhereas mobile platforms have rich service-bound APIs that allow apps to deliver their experience when backgrounded, most of the web platform's capabilities are tab-coupled. Audio for instance only works when the tab is alive, so when a tab is killed in the background that plays audio, there is no way to keep that tab playing sound. A [list of background use-cases is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.5kyzj3e4880y). In an ideal world, web apps would be able to deliver the experience they want to their users, without having to rely on their page always being resident and running on the machine.\n\n### Lifecycle States\n![Lifecycle States](https://github.com/spanicker/web-lifecycle/blob/master/LifecycleStates.png)\n\nFor details on the app lifecycle states and definitions see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.edtdhepwctwy).\n\nThis proposal formalizes states for FROZEN and DISCARDED.\n\nLifecycle State | Visibility | Developer Expectation | System Interventions\n--------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------\nFROZEN | Typically HIDDEN frames will be FROZEN. It is possible for visible frames to be FROZEN | Hand off for background work and stop execution. Teardown and release resources. Report to analytics | CPU suspension: stop CPU after N minutes based on resource constraints\nDISCARDED | Typically FROZEN frames will be moved to DISCARDED. It is possible for PASSIVE frames to be DISCARDED | System has discarded background tab to reclaim memory. If user revisits tab, this will reload the tab. | Tab discarding for memory saving: fully unloaded, no memory consumption.\n\n- Lifecycle states apply to frames: both toplevel and nested.\n- When a background tab is transitioned to FROZEN, the entire frame tree will be consistently moved to FROZEN\n\n### End-of-life scenarios\nThere are 3 high level scenarios for “end-of-life”.\n#### 1. System Exit (Interventions)\nThe system moves the app to FROZEN state and stops CPU usage, or the system moves the app to DISCARDED state and discards the app to reclaim memory. Handling this is in-scope for this proposal.\\\nFor detailed Scenarios and Requirements, see the [list here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.rsruvllnv993).\n\nOn system exit, there is no guaranteed callback at the (very) time of system exit. This is consistent with mobile platforms (Android and iOS): in Android onPause is the guaranteed callback for user exit, on iOS the equivalent is willResignActive.\nOn Android and iOS the system kills background apps that were previously stopped / frozen; corresponding callbacks have already fired and there is no callback before system kill.\n\n#### 2. User Exit\nThe user may close the tab (foreground or background) or navigate away OR on mobile, swipe the app away from task switcher. The user may background the app by minimizing the window OR on mobile by going to the homescreen and task switcher.\\\nOn user exit, the browser should **guarantee** that *one* callback will fire and finish, before the app is torn down.\n\nFor categories of work that happen in end-of-life see the [list of End-of-life use-cases here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.qftifuoc2315).\n\n#### 3. Unexpected Termination\nApps can get killed in scenarios where it is not possible to deliver a callback, such as OOM crashes, OS kills the process under memory pressure, crashes or hangs due to browser bugs, device runs out of battery etc. Therefore it is possible for apps to transition from any state to TERMINATED without any callback being fired.\\\n\nIt is not possible to have a guaranteed callback execute in most of these scenarios.\n\n## MVP API\n![Lifecycle Callbacks](https://github.com/spanicker/web-lifecycle/blob/master/LifecycleCallbacks.png)\n\nWe following changes are included in the MVP:\n\n* `onfreeze` is fired to signal transition to FROZEN.\n* `onresume` is fired to signal transition out of FROZEN. This will be used to undo what was done in `onfreeze` above. \n* On DISCARDED -> ACTIVE, an attribute called `wasDiscarded` is added to the Document. This will be used to restore view state , when the user revisits a discarded tab.\n* `onfreeze` is also fired before transition to BFCACHE (before `pagehide` is fired) and `onresume` is also fired on transition out of BFCACHE (after `pageshow` is fired).\n\nSuggestion for implementers: before moving app to DISCARDED it is recommended to run `beforeunload` handler and if it returns string (i.e. needs to show modal dialog) then the tab discard should be omitted, to prevent risk of data loss.\n\n### Reusing existing callbacks vs. Adding new callbacks\nA previous version of this proposal reused pagehide / pageshow callbacks.\nWith the requirement that visible and occluded (ACTIVE & PASSIVE) frames can be FROZEN (not just HIDDEN frames), the cons really outweighed the pros of reusing. For detailed pros and cons see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.5l9dky87m2l0).\n\n### Why add new callbacks at all?\nWhy cannot web apps simply use existing callbacks to deal with FROZEN and DISCARDED states?\nThe callbacks are necessary for several reasons:\n* Teardown and setup of expensive resources such as IDB and Web Locks\n* Many apps rely on unload handler and no further callbacks are fired after onfreeze if the page is discarded. onfreeze provides a final callback for this need.\n    * Apps that often have multiple tabs open, such as Google Docs, need to coordinate app state across these tabs. Such apps rely on getting a callback before the page goes away, eg. Google Docs needs to release their (custom) lock.\n    * Final communication to the server\n* Platform predictability and transparency in the face of freezing & discarding interventions becoming the norm. Specifically helping:\n    * Analytics\n    * Testing story\n    \nFor details see [this section of detailed doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.s64wegvpugn9).\n\n### API\n\n#### Additions to Document interface:\n```\npartial interface Document {\n    attribute EventHandler onfreeze;\n    attribute EventHandler onresume;\n    readonly attribute boolean wasDiscarded;\n};\n```\n\n#### Handling transition to FROZEN:\n```\nfunction handleFreeze(e) {\n   // Handle transition to FROZEN\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"freeze\", handleFreeze);\n\nOR\ndocument.onfreeze = function() { … }\n```\nNOTE: subsequently the app may get discarded, without firing another callback.\n\n#### Handling transition out of FROZEN:\n```\nfunction handleResume(e) {\n    // handle state transition FROZEN -> ACTIVE\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"resume\", handleResume);\n\nOR\ndocument.onresume = function() { … }\n```\n#### Handling of discarding, on next load:\n```\n// If the tab was previously discarded, get the persisted state for the\n// client ID of the discarded tab:\nif (document.wasDiscarded) {\n  getPersistedState(self.lastClientId);\n}\n```\n\n#### Potential future addition\nIn the future, if frame-level freezing (i.e. freeze specific frames within a page) is pursued, then the API could be enhanced to indicate which frame tree is frozen.\n```\n// Indicate what is frozen exactly: \n// a. partial frame tree starting with current frame\n// b. partial frame tree starting with an ancestor frame\n// c. entire page in background\n// d. ...\nenum FrameLevel { ... };\n\ninterface FreezeEvent {\n    readonly attribute FrameLevel frameLevel; \n}\n```\n\n### Callbacks in State Transition Scenarios\n* A. System stops (CPU suspension) background tab; user revisits\\\n[HIDDEN] -------------> `onfreeze` [FROZEN]\\\n--(user revisit)----> `onresume` [ACTIVE]\n\n* B. System discards frozen tab; user revisits\\\n(previously called `onfreeze`----> [FROZEN]\\\n----(tab discard)----> <no callback here> [DISCARDED]\\\n--(user revisit)----> [LOADING] -> (`Document::wasDiscarded` is set) [ACTIVE]\n\n* C. System discards background tab; user revisits\\\n[HIDDEN] ---(tab discard)------>\\\n`onfreeze` [FROZEN] ---(system tab discard)---> [DISCARDED]\\\n--(user revisit)----> [LOADING] -> (`Document::wasDiscarded` is set) [ACTIVE]\n\nState Transition | Lifecycle Callback | Trigger | Expected Developer Action\n---------------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------------------------\nACTIVE -> HIDDEN | `onvisibilitychange (hidden)` (already exists) | Desktop: tab is in background, or window is fully hidden; Mobile: user clicks on task switcher or homescreen | stop UI work; persist app state; report to analytics\nHIDDEN -> ACTIVE | `onvisibilitychange (visible)` (already exists) | User revisits background tab | undo what was done above; report to analytics\nHIDDEN -> FROZEN | `onfreeze` | System initiated CPU suspension; OR user navigate with bfcache | report to analytics; teardown, release resources; hand off for background work and stop execution. Save transient UI state in case app is moved to DISCARDED.\nFROZEN -> ACTIVE | `onresume` | user revisits FROZEN tab or navigates back (bfcache) | undo what was done above; report to analytics\nFROZEN -> DISCARDED | (no callback) | System initiated tab-discard | (no advance warning here)\nDISCARDED -> ACTIVE | (`Document::wasDiscarded` is set) | user revisits tab after system tab discard | restore transient UI state\n\n### Restrictions and Capabilities in proposed callbacks\nIf excessive work is performed in the `onfreeze` callback fired on FROZEN, there is a cost to this in terms of resource consumption i.e. CPU, network.\nWe need to strike a balance between enabling the system to move the app to FROZEN for conserving resources AND enabling the app to take action without consuming excessive resources in these callbacks.\nTo accomplish this, the following will apply to the callback:\n- network activity will be disallowed, except for fetch keep-alive. This will allow final communication with server as well as meet needs of analytics.\n- upper time limit of 500ms (total wall time) will be imposed. If the time limit is exceeded, the page will be discarded (instead of being FROZEN)\n- legitimate async work like writing to IndexedDB will be supported. Current proposal for supporting this is here: https://github.com/w3c/IndexedDB/issues/234.\n\n### Guarantess for end-of-life callbacks\n\n**What should be the “guaranteed” callback for the Web?**\n\nWe should align with the mobile model (Android and iOS) on the web. For this we need to ensure the following:\n1. on user exit: only one callback is guaranteed to fire and complete\n2. on system exit: above callback should have already fired, yet another callback is not guaranteed to fire (guarantee is simply not possible in many cases)\n\nFor #1, ideally all apps will transition through PASSIVE state before they can be killed and potentially we could, in the future, introduce a new callback here -- that is guaranteed.\nIn practice though, there is already a callback that is \"somewhat guaranteed\" - this is onvisibilitychange (there are bugs in browsers, causing it to not fire in some cases, and it is not really guaranteed on mobile).\nFor instance on mobile web, if the user goes to the homescreen OR task-switcher and then swipes away, then onvisibilitychange (with visibilityState being set to hidden) will fire (on homescreen, task-switcher) no other callback is fired on swipe (unload, pagehide etc).\n\n**NOTE**: On Android onvisibilitychange is called from the onStop method of Activity lifecycle which is NOT guaranteed to fire. If we added a callback for transition to PASSIVE (in the future), then it could be called from onPause method of Activity lifecycle - which is guaranteed to fire. Therefore adding a callback for PASSIVE state would be helpful for Android.\n\nWhile unload callback is widely used, it is fundamentally unreliable, for instance it does not fire on mobile if user goes to task-switcher and then swipes. There are currently no plans to make unload more reliable. (The long term vision is to replace it with declarative APIs for desktop)\n\nFor #2, callback for FROZEN state is not guaranteed on user exit scenarios.\nOn system exit scenarios, typically FROZEN callback (at least onvisibilitychange for sure) would have already fired previously BUT there is no guarantee that FROZEN callback *must* have fired.\n\n### Further Reading\nFor details on the following topics see the Master Doc:\n* [Persisting Transient View State](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.9u8nhnl3oez)\n* [Handling of Web Workers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.gam3mhyangg4)\n* [Handling Background Work and role of Service Worker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.w3vi1ouug35y)\n* [Alternative Considered: reusing existing callbacks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.5l9dky87m2l0)\n* [Alternative Considered: no new callbacks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuS6ff4Fd4igZgL50LDS8MeROVrOfkN13RbiP2nTT9I/edit#heading=h.s64wegvpugn9)\n* [What is bfcache?](https://webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/)\n\n"

These types do not obliterate\nDOM XSS in themselves, as authors may still create an instance of a type with an untrusted value.\nInstead, it simplifies the security analysis of the application - security reviewers don't need to\ndeeply understand and review each and every usage of a given *sink*, but can instead focus their\nefforts on the code that *generates* the typed objects. As long as these \"trusted\" types are always\ngenerated from a small, reviewable subset of overall application code - safe templating libraries,\nsanitizers, and so on, developers can have a high degree of confidence that the risk of DOM-based\nXSS remains low.\n\nGoogle's internal implementation has a number of bells and whistles (and makes a number of\nassumptions about requirements) that probably aren't suitable for the world at large. It would be\ninteresting to explore how we might extract some more generic version of this concept from those\ninternal tools in order to bring this kind of functionality to the web in a generic fashion.\nFor example, different applications might have different opinions about what makes a particular\nHTML snippet \"safe\", but regardless of the definition, it seems clear that the browser is\nwell-positioned to enforce type constraints dynamically at runtime. That would be a substantial\nimprovement over the tight link between the type system and the compiler.\n\n## A Possible Approach\n\nWhile we could jam all sorts of sanitization functionality into such a system, it seems reasonable\nto start small until we know how existing templating systems and sanitizers will layer any\nprimitives we introduce into their existing systems. The following approach seems compelling as a\nfirst step:\n\n1.  Introduce a number of types that correspond to the XSS sinks we wish to protect. For example,\n    we could define a `TrustedHTML` object that marks it as suitable for using via `innerHTML`\n    (instead of a string). Or a `TrustedScriptURL` object that's suitable to be assigned to a\n    `ScriptElement.src` attribute.\n\n    These types should be pretty minimal in nature, making them polyfillable in browsers that don't\n    support them natively.\n\n2.  Enumerate all the XSS sinks we wish to protect, and overload each of them with a variant that\n    accepts the matching type. For example, `Element.innerHTML`'s setter could accept `(DOMString or TrustedHTML)`,\n    and we could overload `document.write(DOMString)` with `document.write(TrustedHTML)`.\n\n    As above, this mechanism should be polyfillable; the polyfilled types define stringifiers which\n    would enable them to be automatically cast into strings when called on existing setters.\n\n3.  Introduce a mechanism for disabling the raw string version of each of the sinks identified\n    above. For example, `Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types`\n    header could cause the `innerHTML` setter to throw a `TypeError` if a raw string was passed in.\n\n    This is possible to polyfill for many setters and\n    methods, apart from the ones that aren't marked as [`[Unforgeable]`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#Unforgeable).\n\n### Trusted Types\n\n*   **TrustedHTML**: This type would be used to represent a trusted snippet that could be passed\n    into an HTML context.\n\n    ```\n    interface TrustedHTML {\n      stringifier;\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **TrustedURL**: This type would be used to represent a trusted URL that could be used to load\n    non-scripting resources or navigate a frame.\n\n    ```\n    interface TrustedURL {\n      stringifier;\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **TrustedScriptURL**: This type would be used to represent a URL that could be used to load\n    resources that may result in script execution in the current document.\n\n    ```\n    interface TrustedScriptURL {\n      stringifier;\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **TrustedScript**: This type would be used to represent a trusted JavaScript code block i.e.\n    something that is trusted by the author to be executed by adding it to a `<script>` element\n    content, inline event handler or passing to an `eval` function family.\n\n    ```\n    interface TrustedScript {\n      stringifier;\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Policies\n\nIntroducing and requiring typed objects is, sadly, not sufficient: Exposing raw Trusted Types constructors to the web authors presents a significant problem, in that\nit only marginally improves the situation: while it allows certain libraries to produce and use typed\nvalues in place of strings, it also allows constructing the types at will (see https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/issues/31), and every\ntyped value construction in the application is a potential DOM XSS. Consider the following code\nsnippet from the previous version of the API:\n\n```javascript\n// DEPRECATED.\nnode.innerHTML = TrustedHTML.unsafelyCreate(variable)\n```\n\nReasoning about DOM XSS susceptibility of an application riddled with the statements like above\nis just as hard, as it was in the original DOM API. Therefore we propose the concept of *policies*\n(not to be confused with CSP).\n\nRaw typed object constructors from a string are forbidden. Instead, we introduce a programmatic\nJavaScript API, allowing web authors to specify how the aforementioned objects can be created.\nAn application can create multiple named policies for a document. Typed objects can be constructed from a\nstring only by invoking one of those policies.\n\nFor example, an application may define a policy, in which `TrustedScriptURL` is a same-origin URL or the domain is from a whitelisted domain list. A\nseparate policy may pass a string through a custom HTML sanitization function before producing a\n`TrustedHTML` object. As authors may create multiple policies with different rules, application may\nhand over certain policies to separate submodules of its codebase, guarding how those submodules can\ninteract with DOM.\n\nFor example: the application author trusts the Foo library not to cause DOM XSS (it's known\nto have a very robust HTML sanitizer, was already security reviewed and is well-maintained), so it\nmay initialize Foo with a no-op policy. At the same time, a 3rd party chat widget, or an Analytics\nscript should only be trusted to create `<div>` and `<img>` elements, so it's initialized with a\npolicy that only allows for that, and escapes (or removes) any other content.\n\nSuch API allows the authors to specify a set of policies that guard the typed objects creation.\nAs valid trusted type objects must originate from a policy, those policies alone form the **trusted codebase in regards to DOM XSS**, reducing the attack and security review surface considerably.\n\n#### Policies API\n\n```\ninterface TrustedTypePolicyFactory {\n    TrustedTypePolicy createPolicy(DOMString policyName, TrustedTypeInnerPolicy policy, optional boolean expose = false);\n    TrustedTypePolicy getExposedPolicy(DOMString policyName);\n    Array<DOMString> getPolicyNames();\n}\n```\nWe propose to provide a `TrustedTypePolicyFactory` implementation under `window.TrustedTypes`. The most important function available in a `TrustedTypePolicyFactory` is `createPolicy`.\n\nThe policy rules for creating individual types are configured via the properties of `TrustedTypeInnerPolicy` object. Note that the functions operate on strings. The actual type construction is provided by the private API, not exposed to the authors.\n\n```\ninterface TrustedTypeInnerPolicy {\n    string createHTML(string);\n    string createURL(string);\n    string createScriptURL(string);\n    string createScript(string);\n}\n```\n\nPolicy (with a unique name) can be created like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst myPolicy = TrustedTypes.createPolicy('https://example.com#mypolicy', {\n    createHTML: (s) => { return customSanitize(s) },\n    createURL: (s) => { /* parse and validate the url. throw if non-conformant */ },\n})\n```\n\nThe policy object is returned, and can be used as a capability to create typed objects i.e. code parts without a reference to the policy object cannot use it.\n\nOptionally, the policy may be exposed globally by calling `createPolicy` with `expose` argument set to `true`. Exposed policies can be retrieved via `TrustedTypes.getExposedPolicy`. This mode is recommended only for the strict, sanitizing, \"last resort\" type of policies.\n\nThe policy object can be used directly to create typed values that conform to its rules:\n\n```javascript\n const trustedHtml = myPolicy.createHTML('<p>ok<script>not ok</script></p>')\n document.body.innerHTML = trustedHtml // does not throw.\n trustedHtml.toString() // <p>ok</p>, as the customSanitize removed the script.\n```\n\nThis forms the core of the API, but there are additional features in development, it's best to see\nthe polyfill code.\n\n#### Limiting policies\n\nWe propose to allow for whitelisting policy names in a CSP, e.g. in a following fashion:\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: trusted-types foo bar\n```\n\nThat will assure that no additional policies are created at runtime. Creating a policy with a name\nthat was already created, or was not specified in the CSP throws, so introduction of non-reviewed\npolicies breaks the application functionally.\n\n#### Default policy\n\nThere is an experimental support for a default policy that allows applications\nto use strings with the injection sinks. These strings would be passed to a single\nuser-defined policy that sanitizes the value or rejects it. The intention is to\nallow for a gradual migration of the code from strings towards Trusted Types.\nPlease check the [specification draft](https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/#default-policy-hdr) for details.\n\n### DOM Sinks\n\n*   **HTML Contexts**: Given something like `typedef (DOMString or TrustedHTML) HTMLString`, we'd\n    poke at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Element {\n        attribute HTMLString innerHTML;\n        attribute HTMLString outerHTML;\n        void insertAdjacentHTML(DOMString position, HTMLString text);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Document {\n        void write(HTMLString text);\n        void writeln(HTMLString text);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface DOMParser {\n        Document parseFromString(HTMLString str, SupportedType type);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Range {\n        DocumentFragment createContextualFragment(HTMLString fragment);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface HTMLIFrameElement {\n         DOMString srcdoc;\n    };\n    ```\n\n*   **URL Contexts**: Given something like `typedef (USVString or TrustedURL) URLString`, we'd poke\n    at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Location {\n        stringifier attribute URLString href;\n        void assign(URLString url);\n        void replace(URLString url);\n\n        // (These aren't `URLString`, but they should be something)\n        DOMString pathname;\n        DOMString search;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    // A few element types go here. `HTMLBaseElement`, `HTMLLinkElement`\n    // `HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils` from a quick skim through HTML.\n    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {\n        attribute URLString href;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    // A few element types go here. `HTMLSourceElement`, `HTMLImageElement`,\n    // `HTMLIFrameElement`, `HTMLTrackElement`, `HTMLMediaElement`,\n    // `HTMLInputElement`,  `HTMLFrameElement`\n    // from a quick skim through HTML.\n    //\n    // The same applies to their SVG variants.\n    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {\n        attribute URLString src;\n        attribute URLString srcset; // Only `HTMLSourceElement` and `HTMLImageElement`\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface HTMLObjectElement : HTMLElement {\n        attribute URLString data;\n        attribute URLString codebase;\n    };\n    ```\n    ```\n    partial interface Document {\n        attribute URLString location;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Window {\n        attribute URLString location;\n        void open(URLString location);\n    };\n    ```\n\n* **Script URL Context**: Given something like `typedef (USVString or TrustedScriptURL) ScriptURLString`,\n    we'd poke at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:\n\n    ```\n    partial interface WorkerGlobalScope {\n        void importScripts(ScriptURLString... urls);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    // A few element types go here. `HTMLEmbedElement`, `HTMLScriptElement`\n    // from a quick skim through HTML.\n    //\n    // The same applies to their SVG variants.\n    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {\n        attribute ScriptURLString src;\n    };\n    ```\n\n*   **JavaScript Contexts**: Replace `DOMString` in the following with something\n    reasonable.\n\n    ```\n    partial interface Window {\n        void eval(DOMString code);\n        void setTimeout(DOMString code, int timeout);\n        void setInterval(DOMString code, int timeout);\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    partial interface HTMLScriptElement : HTMLElement {\n        attribute DOMString innerText;\n        attribute DOMString text;\n        attribute DOMString textContent;\n    };\n    ```\n\n## Open Questions\n\nSome details have still not been sketched out - see [issues](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/issues).\n\n## Polyfill\n\nThis repository contains a polyfill implementation. The compiled versions are stored in [`dist` directory](dist/)\n\n### Browsers\nThe es5/es6 builds can be loaded directly in the browsers. There are two variants of the browser polyfill - **api_only** (light) and **full**. The *api_only* variant defines the API, so you can create policies and types. *Full* version also enables the type enforcement in the DOM, based on the CSP policy it infers from the current document (see [src/polyfill/full.js](src/polyfill/full.js)).\n\n```html\n<!-- API only -->\n<script src=\"https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/es5/trustedtypes.api_only.build.js\"></script>\n<script>\n     const p = TrustedTypes.createPolicy('foo', ...)\n     document.body.innerHTML = p.createHTML('foo'); // works\n     document.body.innerHTML = 'foo'; // but this one works too (no enforcement).\n</script>\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Full -->\n<script src=\"https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/es5/trustedtypes.build.js\" data-csp=\"trusted-types foo bar\"></script>\n<script>\n    TrustedTypes.createPolicy('foo', ...);\n    TrustedTypes.createPolicy('unknown', ...); // throws\n    document.body.innerHTML = 'foo'; // throws\n</script>\n\n```\n\n### NodeJS\nCommonJS polyfill is published as an npm package [trusted-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trusted-types):\n\n```\n$ npm install trusted-types\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst tt = require('trusted-types');\ntt.createPolicy(...);\n```\n### Tinyfill\n\nDue to the way the API is designed, it's possible to polyfill the most important\nAPI surface (`TrustedTypes.createPolicy` function) with the following snippet:\n\n```\nif(typeof TrustedTypes == “undefined”)TrustedTypes={createPolicy:(n, rules) => rules};\n```\nIt does not enable the enforcement, but allows the creation of policies that\nreturn string values instead of Trusted Types in non-supporting browsers. Since\nthe injection sinks in those browsers accept strings, the values will be accepted\nunless the policy throws an error. This tinyfill code allows most applications\nto work in both Trusted-Type-enforcing and a legacy environment.\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the polyfill yourself (Java required):\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/mikewest/trusted-types/\n$ cd trusted-types\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n## Demo\nTo see the polyfill in action, visit the [demo page](https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/demo/).\n\n## Testing\nIt can be tested by running:\n```\n$ npm test\n```\nThe polyfill can also be run against the [web platform test suite](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests), but that requires small patches to the suite - see [tests/platform-tests/platform-tests-runner.sh](tests/platform-tests/platform-tests-runner.sh).\n\n# Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n# Questions?\n\nOur [wiki](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/wiki) or the [specification](https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/) may already contain an answer\nto your question.

            "text": "# Spatial Navigation\n\n**Written**: 2017-10-17, **Updated**: 2018-12-12\n\n**Spatial Navigation** provides a processing model and standards APIs for directional(top/left/bottom/right) focus navigation using arrow keys, jog shuttle, and gesture on several devices. (e.g. TV, feature phone, game console, IVI system)\n\nThis repository is for supportive tools such as polyfill, demo, and relevant documents. The spatial navigation [spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nav-1/) has been migrated from WICG to CSS WG as an official draft according to the [decision](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/23-css-minutes.html#item01) at the CSS WG meeting in TPAC 2018.\n\nYou can raise a spec issue in [CSS WG](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-nav-1), but also raise others(polyfill, demo, ideas) in [WICG](https://github.com/WICG/spatial-navigation/issues) here.\n\n## Details\n* Read the [Spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nav-1/)\n* Read the [Explainer](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nav-1/explainer)\n* Play with the [Polyfill](polyfill/README.md)\n* Try the [Demo](https://wicg.github.io/spatial-navigation/demo/)\n* See the [Implementation Status](implStatus.md)\n* Give feedback on [issues for spec](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-nav-1) in CSS WG or [issues for others](https://github.com/WICG/spatial-navigation/issues) in WICG\n\n## Overview\n**Spatial navigation** is the ability to navigate between focusable elements based on their position within a structured document. Spatial navigation is often called 'directional navigation' which enables four(top/left/bottom/right) directional navigation. Users are usually familiar with the 2-way navigation using both 'tab key' for the forward direction and 'shift+tab key' for the backward direction, but not familiar with the 4-way navigation using arrow keys.\n\nRegarding TV remote control, game console pad, IVI jog dial with 4-way keys, and Web accessibility, the spatial navigation has been a rising important input mechanism in several industries. If the web can embrace the spatial navigation and efficiently support the functionalities in web engines and W3C standard APIs, it will be more promising technology for existing products as mentioned above and various upcoming smart devices.\n\n## Requirement\nPrior to the requirement explanation, we need to first understand how the arrow keys currently work on the web. If you're watching this page in a normal HD monitor and desktop, not mobile, please push a down-arrow key on your keyboard. What happens? Basically, scrolling downward would be triggered. That's the default behavior of arrow keys in the web, only when the page is scrollable in the direction.\n\nIn spatial navigation mode, the default behavior of arrow keys is changed from scrolling behavior to focus moving so that users can use the arrow keys to navigate between focusable elements based on their position. To support the functionalities of the spatial navigation, we should consider the following three steps:\n1. A heuristic algorithm to be supported in web engines by default (e.g. how to judge a next best focusable element)\n2. Overriding methods on top of the heuristic algorithm (DOM method/attribute/event as standard APIs)\n3. Some relevant APIs for efficiently supporting the spatial navigation (e.g. setting an element as a container)\n\nSee the [explainer](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nav-1/explainer) for the details of W3C standardization for #1, #2 and #3 above.\n\nSee the [implStatus](implStatus.md) for the details of the implementation in web engines for #1 above.\n\n## FAQ\n**Q. I’m not sure how the spatial navigation works.**\n- You can see the video that shows the spatial navigation operations in the YouTube page ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzDtcX9urUg)).\n- You can see the brief description for the spatial navigation in Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_navigation)).\n- In several references below, you can get the help to understand the spatial navigation operation better.\n\n**Q. Isn’t it enough just using the relevant web frameworks?**\n- Several web frameworks and extensions for the spatial navigation have been provided so far due to no support from web engines. For examples, [js-spatial-navigation](https://github.com/luke-chang/js-spatial-navigation) made by Mozilla seems one of the frameworks and its quality would be good to support the features of the spatial navigation. [Spotlight library](https://github.com/enyojs/spotlight) implemented by LGE is also an instance of the frameworks for the spatial navigation, even though it was deprecated now. However, the support of spatial navigation from web frameworks has some limits as follows:\n  - Difficult to align native scroll behavior when moving the focus to an element out of view\n  - Difficult to align native focus method for a11y support\n  - Performance degradation due to the expensive cost of DOM Access\n  - Inconsistency of user experience (various kinds of frameworks)\n  - Impossible to control isolated frames like iframe and shadow DOM\n\n**Q. The spatial navigation seems not the general feature esp. in mobile with no physical key-based interface.**\n- Honestly, the mobile(feature phone) has been a first citizen of the spatial navigation about ten years old. Before touch-based interface, the majority of interface for mobile was the key-based interface. Recently(2018-2019), [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/)-based feature phones have been propagated mainly in several developing countries such as Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. The devices doesn't support a touch interface, so users need to use the arrow keys to select a item on all applications including a browser.\n\n- In the future, the input mechanism for smart devices will change to something like voice command, hand gesture, and gaze direction, but the key-based interface will never disappear, even though it'll be used as a secondary method. The key-based interface used to be evaluated as one of the most intuitive ways with a strong sense feedback of finger after pushing a key, as if it's inconvenient a touch-based keyboard without any physical keys.\n\n**Q.

            "text": "# DevTools Protocol\n\nThis repository is for resources and discussion around aligning the developer tools protocol used by various browsers, JavaScript engines and debugging tools.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Help empower web developers to build great applications by supporting an ecosystem of diagnostics tools which work well across a variety of targets.\n- Reduce the need for target-specific \"devtools protocol adapters\" in order to simplify the experience for tool users and tool developers.\n- Provide a vendor-neutral forum to facilitate collaboration and consensus building between different protocol implementations and interested clients.\n- Reduce the engineering investment necessary to build compatible protocol implementations through sharing of test cases.\n\n[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) from the community are welcome!\n\n## What is here in this repo\n\nNot much yet, just a [few issues](https://github.com/WICG/devtools-protocol/issues) tracking work we'd like to do and links to a few resources below.\n\n## Implementations\nEngines and browsers that all have a [similar](http://compatibility.remotedebug.org/) debugging protocol built-in:\n- [Chrome DevTools](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/), also used by most other chromium-based browsers\n- [WebKit / Safari](https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/inspector/protocol)\n- [Node.js](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/v8/)\n- Firefox - [in development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/4-4A8W-nP5g/Y9C9UkWTAAAJ)\n- [Edge DevTools Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-protocol/)\n\nAdapters that expose a common protocol:\n- [Microsoft Edge Diagnostics Adapter](https://github.com/Microsoft/edge-diagnostics-adapter) - to be replaced with native support (above).\n- [RemoteDebug iOS WebKit Adapter](https://github.com/RemoteDebug/remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter)\n- See also [RemoteDebug list of adapters](https://remotedebug.org/adaptors/)\n\n## Clients\nThere are a variety of tools which target some or all of the above implementations of the protocol.  Here are a few resources:\n- [Chrome DevTools protocol clients](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/awesome-chrome-devtools#chrome-devtools-protocol)\n- [VS Code debuggers](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core/blob/master/README.md)\n- [RemoteDebug integrations](https://remotedebug.org/integrations/)\n- [sonarwhal](https://sonarwhal.com/)\n\n## Key Use Cases\n\n- Unified JavaScript debugging from a single IDE to multiple engines, eg.\n  - Chrome DevTools stepping between front-end JavaScript running in Chrome and back-end JavaScript running in Node.js\n  - VS Code IDE debugging pages running in Safari, Edge, Firefox or Chrome\n  \n## Out of scope\n\n- 100% compatibility across protocol implementations\n  - It is sometimes necessary, or even just convenient, for engine implementation details to leak out through the behavior of the devtools protocol (eg. performance visualizations are often very coupled to engine implementation details such as GPU \"layers\").\n  - The goal here is to align behavior and APIs where it is practical without constraining engines.  \n- Producing a formal protocol specification or standard\n  - A formal specification for a subset of the protocols used in practice may someday be in-scope.\n  - But for now our focus is just in facilitating implementations and reducing engineering effort within the community where practical.\n- APIs for automated testing\n  - Test cases are fundamentally different clients than developer tools in a few important ways:\n   - We should expect there to be orders of magnitude more test cases in the world than tools.  I.e. they're much harder to update so API stability is critical.\n   - It's important for the openness of the web that any browser can, in principle, run test cases originally designed for other browsers.  I.e. a full standard and conformance test suite is critical.\n  - Therefore this community recommends the [WebDriver API](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) and tools built upon it (eg. [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)) as the right tool for automated testing.\n"

            "text": "# KV Storage\n\nThis document is an explainer for a potential future web platform feature, \"KV storage\" (short for \"key/value storage\"). It's similar to [`localStorage`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#webstorage) in utility, but much more modern, and layered on top of IndexedDB.\n\n_This feature was formerly known as \"async local storage\", but in [#38](https://github.com/domenic/kv-storage/issues/38), folks pointed out that since we don't intend to access the `localStorage` database itself, that name was misleading._\n\nThis feature would be implemented as a [built-in module](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/). It would also use IndexedDB as its backing store; see more on that below.\n\nA [full specification](https://domenic.github.io/kv-storage/) is also available.\n\nAt [TPAC 2018](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/TPAC/Overview.html), the Web Platform Working Group and the [IndexedDB](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) specification editors [agreed](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/22-WebPlat-minutes.html#item05) that after incubation in the WICG, KV storage should graduate to be part of the W3C IndexedDB specification.\n\n## Sample code\n\n```js\nimport { storage } from \"std:kv-storage\"; // specifier prefix not final\n\n(async () => {\n  await storage.set(\"mycat\", \"Tom\");\n  console.assert(await storage.get(\"mycat\") === \"Tom\");\n\n  for await (const [key, value] of storage.entries()) {\n    console.log(key, value);\n  }\n  // Logs \"mycat\", \"Tom\"\n\n  await storage.delete(\"mycat\");\n  console.assert(await storage.get(\"mycat\") === undefined);\n})();\n```\n\n## Motivation\n\nLocal storage is a well-known and well-loved API. It only has one problem: it's synchronous. This leads to [terrible performance](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/there-is-no-simple-solution-for-local-storage/) and cross-window synchronization issues.\n\nThe alternative is IndexedDB. IndexedDB is, however, quite hard to use. It has no simple key/value layer, instead requiring understanding concepts like database upgrades and transactions. Its API is also quite dated; it does not use promises, but instead `IDBRequest` objects with their `onsuccess` and `onerror` methods.\n\nIn the face of this, a cottage industry of solutions for \"async key/value storage\" have sprung up to wrap IndexedDB. Perhaps the most well-known of these is [localForage](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/), which copies the `localStorage` API directly.\n\nAfter many years of convergence in library-space on this sort of solution, it's time to bring a simple async key/value storage solution out of the cold and into the web platform.\n\n## API\n\n### `Map`-like key/value pair API\n\nNote that keys and values would be allowed to be any [structured-serializable type](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/structured-data.html#serializable-objects) (see [#2](https://github.com/domenic/kv-storage/issues/2) for more discussion).\n\n#### `set(key, value)`\n\nSets the value of the entry identified by `key` to `value`. Returns a promise that fulfills with `undefined` once this is complete.\n\n_Note: setting an entry to have the value `undefined` is equivalent to deleting it. See discussion in [#3](https://github.com/domenic/kv-storage/issues/3)._\n\n#### `get(key)`\n\nReturns a promise for the value of the entry identified by `key`, or `undefined` if no value is present.\n\n#### `delete(key)`\n\nRemoves the entry identified by `key`, if it exists. Once this completes, returns a promise for undefined.\n\n_Note: this is equivalent to `set(key, undefined)`. See discussion in [#3](https://github.com/domenic/kv-storage/issues/3)._\n\n#### `clear()`\n\nClears all entries. Returns a promise for `undefined`.\n\n#### `keys()`\n\nReturns an async iterator for all the stored keys, sorted in the underlying IndexedDB key order.\n\n#### `values()`\n\nReturns an async iterator for all the stored values, sorted to correspond with `keys()`.\n\n#### `entries()`\n\nReturns an async iterator of `[key, value]` pairs, sorted to correspond with `keys()`.\n\n### `new StorageArea()`: separate storage areas\n\nWe additionally expose a `StorageArea` constructor, which allows you to create an \"isolated\" storage area that is less likely to collide than using the default one:\n\n```js\nimport { storage, StorageArea } from \"std:kv-storage\";\n\n(async () => {\n  await storage.set(\"mycat\", \"Tom\");\n  console.assert(await storage.get(\"mycat\") === \"Tom\");\n\n  const otherStorage = new StorageArea(\"unique string\");\n  console.assert(await otherStorage.get(\"mycat\") === undefined);\n  await otherStorage.set(\"mycat\", \"Jerry\");\n  console.assert(await otherStorage.get(\"mycat\") === \"Jerry\");\n})();\n```\n\nThis sort of API has [precedent in localForage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localforage#multiple-instances), which is notable since localForage otherwise sticks rather strictly to the `localStorage` API surface.\n\nThe scope of the default storage area would be per-realm. (Or more precisely, per module map, since it would be created whenever you imported the module.)\n\n### `backingStore`: falling back to IndexedDB\n\nOne of the great things about layering KV storage on top of IndexedDB is that, if the developer's code grows beyond the capabilities of a simple key/value store, they can easily transition to the full power of IndexedDB (such as using transactions, indices, or cursors), while reusing their database.\n\nTo facilitate this, we include an API that allows you to get a `{ database, store, version }` object identifying the IndexedDB database and store within that database where a given `StorageArea`'s data is being stored:\n\n```js\nimport { storage } from \"std:kv-storage\";\nimport { open as idbOpen } from \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb/pretend-this-was-a-native-JS-module\";\n\n(async () => {\n  await storage.set(\"mycat\", \"Tom\");\n  await storage.set(\"mydog\", \"Joey\");\n\n  const { database, store, version } = storage.backingStore;\n  const db = await idbOpen(database, version);\n  const tx = db.transaction(store, \"readwrite\");\n  tx.objectStore(store).add(\"mycat\", \"Jerry\");\n  tx.objectStore(store).add(\"mydog\", \"Kelby\");\n  await tx.complete;\n  await db.close();\n})();\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- Developers would be steered away from the perils of `localStorage`, toward this modern, attractive alternative.\n- Applications would no longer need to ship complex IndexedDB logic, or the 9.5 KB localForage library.\n\nlocalForage is downloaded [~227K times per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localforage) via npm.\n\nAnother notable library in this vein is [idb-keyval](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-keyval), which is downloaded ~119K times per week via npm.\n\nFor comparison, Angular is downloaded [~2.314 million times per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core), React [~6.312 million times per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), and Vue [~995K times per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue).\n\n(All of the above statistics are as of 2019-03-14.)\n"

To make substantive contributions, you must join the Community Group, thus signing the CLA.\n\n## Editing the specification\n\nEdits to the specification are done in the `spec.bs` file, which is then compiled with the [Bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/) spec pre-processor.\n\nTo build the specification, you can use one of:\n\n- `make local`: uses a locally-installed copy of Bikeshed\n- `make remote`: uses a Bikeshed web service, so you don't have to install anything locally\n\n## Reference implementation\n\nWe maintain a reference implementation in the [`reference-implementation/`](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/tree/master/reference-implementation) subfolder. This is currently serving as a prototyping ground before we start working on the formal specification. Eventually we anticipate it co-evolving alongside the specification, in the same was as is done for other standards like Streams, URL, and the MIME type parser.\n\n## Tests\n\nThis specification is not yet far enough along to have [web platform tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt). But soon!\n\nIn the meantime, unit tests that validate individual algorithms accompany the reference implementation, and should be updated as part of it.\n\n## For maintainers: identifying contributors to a pull request\n\nIf the author is not the sole contributor to a pull request, please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than the author, which is automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf the author is  making a pull request on behalf of someone else but they had no part in designing the feature, you can remove them with the above syntax.\n"

This solves a variety of important use cases, such as:\n\n- Allowing \"bare import specifiers\", such as `import moment from \"moment\"`, to work\n\n- Providing fallback resolution, so that `import $ from \"jquery\"` can try to go to a CDN first, but fall back to a local version if the CDN server is down\n\n- Enabling polyfilling of, or other control over, [built-in modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/)\n\n- Sharing the notion of \"import specifiers\" between JavaScript importing contexts and traditional URL contexts, such as `fetch()`, `<img src=\"\">` or `<link href=\"\">`\n\nThe mechanism for doing this is via an _import map_ which can be used to control the resolution of module specifiers generally, as well as an `import:` URL scheme to allow access to the same resolution logic in URL-accepting contexts such as HTML and CSS. As an introductory example, consider the code\n\n```js\nimport moment from \"moment\";\nimport { partition } from \"lodash\";\n```\n\nToday, this throws, as such bare specifiers [are explicitly reserved](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#resolve-a-module-specifier). By supplying the browser with the following import map\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"moment\": \"/node_modules/moment/src/moment.js\",\n    \"lodash\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nthe above would act as if you had written\n\n```js\nimport moment from \"/node_modules/moment/src/moment.js\";\nimport { partition } from \"/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js\";\n```\n\nYou would also be able to use these mappings in other contexts via the `import:` URL scheme, e.g.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"import:lodash\">\n```\n\n## Background\n\n### Bare specifiers\n\nWeb developers with experience with pre-ES2015 module systems, such as CommonJS (either in Node or bundled using webpack/browserify for the browser), are used to being able to import modules using a simple syntax:\n\n```js\nconst $ = require(\"jquery\");\nconst { pluck } = require(\"lodash\");\n```\n\nTranslated into the language of JavaScript's built-in module system, these would be\n\n```js\nimport $ from \"jquery\";\nimport { pluck } from \"lodash\";\n```\n\nIn such systems, these bare import specifiers of `\"jquery\"` or `\"lodash\"` are mapped to full filenames or URLs. In more detail, these specifiers represent _packages_, usually distributed on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/); by only specifying the name of the package, they are implicitly requesting the main module of that package.\n\nThe main benefit of this system is that it allows easy coordination across the ecosystem. Anyone can write a module and include an import statement using a package's well-known name, and let the Node.js runtime or their build-time tooling take care of translating it into an actual file on disk (including figuring out versioning considerations).\n\nToday, many web developers are even using JavaScript's native module syntax, but combining it with bare import specifiers, thus making their code unable to run on the web without per-application, ahead-of-time modification. We'd like to solve that, and bring these benefits to the web.\n\n### Built-in modules\n\nWhen considering the introduction of [built-in modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/) to the web, we need to ensure that we do not lose any of the important features we have today when introducing features via new globals. Notably, these include:\n\n- Polyfilling: the ability to supply a polyfill module that acts as the built-in one\n- Virtualization: the ability to wrap, extend, or remove access to the built-in module\n\nBoth of these capabilities are easy to achieve with globals, but without some mechanism for modifying module resolution, they are not possible for modules (including built-in modules). The import maps proposal provides that mechanism.\n\nNote that these use cases are complicated by the need to support browsers without import map support. More on that below.\n\n## The import map\n\nWe explain the features of the import map via a series of examples.\n\n### Specifier remapping examples\n\n#### Bare specifiers for JavaScript modules\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction,\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"moment\": \"/node_modules/moment/src/moment.js\",\n    \"lodash\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\ngives bare import specifier support in JavaScript code:\n\n```js\nimport moment from \"moment\";\nimport(\"lodash\").then(_ => ...);\n```\n\nNote that the right-hand side of the mapping (known as the \"address\") must start with `/`, `../`, or `./`, or be parseable as an absolute URL, to identify a URL. (Other cases are explained [later](#for-built-in-modules-in-module-import-map-supporting-browsers).)\n\n#### \"Packages\" via trailing slashes\n\nIt's common in the JavaScript ecosystem to have a package (in the sense of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) contain multiple modules, or other files. For such cases, we want to map a prefix in the module specifier space, onto another prefix in the fetchable-URL space.\n\nImport maps do this by giving special meaning to specifier keys that end with a trailing slash. Thus, a map like\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"moment\": \"/node_modules/moment/src/moment.js\",\n    \"moment/\": \"/node_modules/moment/src/\",\n    \"lodash\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js\",\n    \"lodash/\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwould allow not only importing the main modules like\n\n```js\nimport moment from \"moment\";\nimport _ from \"lodash\";\n```\n\nbut also non-main modules, e.g.\n\n```js\nimport localeData from \"moment/locale/zh-cn.js\";\nimport fp from \"lodash/fp.js\";\n```\n\n#### General URL-like specifier remapping\n\nAs part of allowing general remapping of specifiers, import maps specifically allow remapping of URL-like specifiers, such as `\"https://example.com/foo.mjs\"` or `\"./bar.mjs\"`. One of the more advanced usages of this is [for fallbacks](#for-built-in-modules-in-browsers-without-import-maps), but here we demonstrate some basic ones to communicate the concept:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"https://www.unpkg.com/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js\": \"/node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis remapping ensures that any imports of the unpkg.com version of Vue (at least at that URL) instead grab the one from the local server.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"/app/helpers.mjs\": \"/app/helpers/index.mjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis remapping ensures that any URL-like imports that resolve to `/app/helpers.mjs`, including e.g. an `import \"./helpers.mjs\"` from files inside `/app/`, or an `import \"../helpers.mjs\"` from files inside `/app/models`, will instead resolve to `/app/helpers/index.mjs`. This is probably not a good idea; instead of creating an indirection which obfuscates your code, you should instead just update your source files to import the correct files. But, it is a useful example for demonstrating the capabilities of import maps.\n\nThe point is that the remapping works the same for URL-like imports as for bare imports. Our previous examples changed the resolution of specifiers like `\"lodash\"`, and thus changed the meaning of `import \"lodash\"`. Here we're changing the resolution of specifiers like `\"/app/helpers.mjs\"`, and thus changing the meaning of `import \"/app/helpers.mjs\"`.\n\n#### Extension-less imports\n\nIt is also common in the Node.js ecosystem to import files without including the extension. [We do not have the luxury](#the-nodejs-module-resolution-algorithm) of trying multiple file extensions until we find a good match. However, we can emulate something similar by using an import map. For example,\n\n```json\n {\n   \"imports\": {\n     \"lodash\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js\",\n     \"lodash/\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/\",\n     \"lodash/fp\": \"/node_modules/lodash-es/fp.js\",\n   }\n }\n```\n\nwould allow not only `import fp from \"lodash/fp.js\"`, but also allow `import fp from \"loadsh/fp\"`.\n\nAlthough this example shows how it is _possible_ to allow extension-less imports with import maps, it's not necessarily _desirable_. Doing so bloats the import map, and makes the package's interface less simple—both for humans and for tooling.\n\nThis bloat is especially problematic if you need to allow extension-less imports within a package. In that case you will need an import map entry for every file in the package, not just the top-level entry points. For example, to allow `import \"./fp\"` from within the `/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js` file, you would need an import entry mapping `/node_modules/lodash-es/fp` to `/node_modules/lodash-es/fp.js`. Now imagine repeating this for every file referenced without an extension.\n\nAs such, we recommend caution when employing patterns like this in your import maps, or writing modules. It will be simpler for the ecosystem if we don't rely on import maps to patch up file-extension related mismatches.\n\n### Fallback examples\n\n#### For user-supplied packages\n\nConsider the case of wanting to use a CDN's copy of a library, but fall back to a local copy if the CDN is unavailable. Today this is often accomplished via [terrible `document.write()`-using sync-script-loading hacks](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CDNsFailButYourScriptsDontHaveToFallbackFromCDNToLocalJQuery.aspx). With import maps providing a first-class way of controlling module resolution, we can do better.\n\nTo provide fallbacks, use an address array, instead of a string address, for the right-hand side of your mapping:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"jquery\": [\n      \"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\",\n      \"/node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, any attempts to import with the specifier `\"jquery\"` will first try to fetch the CDN URL, but if that fails, fall back to the copy in `/node_modules/`. (This fallback process will happen only once, and the choice will be cached for all future imports.)\n\n_Side note: you can think of the string address form as just sugar for a single-element array address. That is, `\"jquery\": \"/node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"` is sugar for `\"jquery\": [\"/node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"]`._\n\n#### For built-in modules, in module-import-map-supporting browsers\n\nWhen a browser supports import maps, we can use the same principle as the above example to support fallbacks for built-in modules.\n\nFor example, consider the following import map, which supplies a polyfill fallback for [KV storage](https://wicg.github.io/kv-storage/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"std:kv-storage\": [\n      \"std:kv-storage\",\n      \"/node_modules/kvs-polyfill/index.mjs\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, statements like\n\n```js\nimport { StorageArea } from \"std:kv-storage\";\n```\n\nwill first try to resolve to the `std:kv-storage` URL, i.e. to the browser's built-in implementation of KV storage. If that fails, e.g. because the browser does not implement KV storage, then instead it will fetch the polyfill, at `/node_modules/kvs-polyfill/index.mjs`.\n\n_Note: the usage of the `std:` prefix for built-in module examples is for illustrative purposes. This proposal is generic, and would be able to work with any built-in module prefix._\n\n#### For built-in modules, in browsers without import maps\n\nThe goal of the previous example is to use a polyfill in older browsers, but the built-in module in newer browsers. But it falls down in the case of browsers that are old enough to not support import maps at all. (That is, all of today's currently-shipping browsers.) In such cases, the statement `import { StorageArea } from \"std:kv-storage\"` will always fail, with no chance to remap it.\n\nHow can we write code that uses a polyfill in today's browsers, but uses built-in modules in future browsers that support them? We do this by changing our import statement to import the _polyfill_'s URL:\n\n```js\nimport { StorageArea } from \"/node_modules/kvs-polyfill/index.mjs\";\n```\n\nand then remapping the polyfill to the built-in module for module-import-map-supporting browsers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"/node_modules/kvs-polyfill/index.mjs\": [\n      \"std:kv-storage\",\n      \"/node_modules/kvs-polyfill/index.mjs\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this mapping, each class of browser behaves as desired, for our above import statement:\n\n- Browsers that do not support import maps will receive the polyfill.\n- Browsers that support import maps, but do not support KV storage, will end up with a mapping from the polyfill URL to itself, and so will receive the polyfill anyway.\n- Browsers that support both import maps and KV storage will end up with a mapping from the polyfill URL to `std:kv-storage`, and so will receive the built-in module.\n\nNote how we're using a capability here that we briefly explored in [a previous example](#general-url-like-specifier-remapping): remapping imports of \"URL-like\" specifiers, not just bare specifiers.\n\n(Note that, in general, there is only one level of resolution. The address is not itself treated as a specifier and recursively remapped.)\n\n##### This doesn't work for `<script>`\n\nAn important caveat to the above example is that it does _not_ help for `<script src=\"\">` scenarios. That is, while\n\n```js\nimport \"/node_modules/virtual-scroller-polyfill/index.mjs\";\n```\n\nwould have the correct behavior (using the built-in version when appropriate) in all classes of browser,\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/node_modules/virtual-scroller-polyfill/index.mjs\"></script>\n```\n\nwould not: in all classes of browsers, it would fetch the polyfill unconditionally. What _would_ work, in import-map-supporting browsers, would be\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"import:/node_modules/virtual-scroller-polyfill/index.mjs\"></script>\n```\n\n(See below for more on the subtleties of `import:` URLs.) But alas, in browsers without support for import maps, this will result in a network error. Thus, for side-effecting modules, you'd instead want to use the pattern\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">import \"/node_modules/virtual-scroller-polyfill/index.mjs\";</script>\n```\n\nwhich will work as desired in all classes of browser.\n\n### Scoping examples\n\n#### Multiple versions of the same module\n\nIt is often the case that you want to use the same import specifier to refer to multiple versions of a single library, depending on who is importing them. This encapsulates the versions of each dependency in use, and avoids [dependency hell](http://npm.github.io/how-npm-works-docs/theory-and-design/dependency-hell.html) ([longer blog post](http://blog.timoxley.com/post/20772365842/node-js-npm-reducing-dependency-overheads)).\n\nWe support this use case in import maps by allowing you to change the meaning of a specifier within a given _scope_:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"querystringify\": \"/node_modules/querystringify/index.js\"\n  },\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/node_modules/socksjs-client/\": {\n      \"querystringify\": \"/node_modules/socksjs-client/querystringify/index.js\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(This is example is one of several [in-the-wild examples](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/5#issuecomment-374175653) of multiple versions per application provided by @zkat. Thanks, @zkat!)\n\nWith this mapping, inside any modules whose URLs start with `/node_modules/socksjs-client/`, the `\"querystringify\"` specifier will refer to `/node_modules/socksjs-client/querystringify/index.js`. Whereas otherwise, the top-level mapping will ensure that `\"querystringify\"` refers to `/node_modules/querystringify/index.js`.\n\n#### Scope inheritance\n\nScopes \"inherit\" from each other in an intentionally-simple manner, merging but overriding as they go. For example, the following import map:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"a\": \"/a-1.mjs\",\n    \"b\": \"/b-1.mjs\",\n    \"c\": \"/c-1.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/scope2/\": {\n      \"a\": \"/a-2.mjs\"\n    },\n    \"/scope2/scope3/\": {\n      \"b\": \"/b-3.mjs\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwould give the following resolutions:\n\n|Specifier|Referrer               |Resulting URL |\n|---------|-----------------------|--------------|\n|a        |/scope1/foo.mjs        |/a-1.mjs      |\n|b        |/scope1/foo.mjs        |/b-1.mjs      |\n|c        |/scope1/foo.mjs        |/c-1.mjs      |\n|         |                       |              |\n|a        |/scope2/foo.mjs        |/a-2.mjs      |\n|b        |/scope2/foo.mjs        |/b-1.mjs      |\n|c        |/scope2/foo.mjs        |/c-1.mjs      |\n|         |                       |              |\n|a        |/scope2/scope3/foo.mjs |/a-2.mjs      |\n|b        |/scope2/scope3/foo.mjs |/b-3.mjs      |\n|c        |/scope2/scope3/foo.mjs |/c-1.mjs      |\n\n### Virtualization examples\n\nAs mentioned above, it's important to be able to wrap, extend, or remove access to built-in modules, the same way you can do with globals. The following examples show how to do this.\n\n_Note: All of the following examples can apply to non built-in modules too, but we show the built-in module cases here._\n\n#### Denying access to a built-in module\n\nAlthough it is drastic and fairly rare, sometimes it is desirable to remove access to certain capabilities from your application. With globals, this can be done via code such as\n\n```js\ndelete self.WebSocket;\n```\n\nWith import maps, you can restrict access by mapping a built-in module to the empty address array, i.e. saying \"there are no URLs or built-in modules that this should map to\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"std:kv-storage\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternately, you can use the form\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"std:kv-storage\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich means the same thing.\n\nWith this in place, any attempts to resolve the `\"std:kv-storage\"` specifier will fail. For example,\n\n```js\nimport { Storage } from \"std:kv-storage\"; // throws\n```\n\n#### Selective denial\n\nYou can use the scoping feature to restrict access to a built-in module to only some parts of your app:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"std:kv-storage\": null\n  },\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/js/storage-code/\": {\n      \"std:kv-storage\": \"std:kv-storage\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(The way in which this map operates within the scope, \"mapping `std:kv-storage` to itself\", may appear a bit confusing. The key is to remember that the left hand side is a module specifier, and the right hand side is a URL. So you can read this as saying that, whenever the `\"std:kv-storage\"` specifier gets imported within that scope, it resolves to the `std:kv-storage` URL.)\n\nAlternately, you can use similar techniques to prevent only certain parts of your app from accessing a built-in module:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/node_modules/untrusted-third-party/\": {\n      \"std:kv-storage\": null\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Wrapping a built-in module\n\nIt may be desirable to wrap a built-in module, e.g. to instrument it, and then ensure that the rest of your application gets access only to the wrapped version. You would do this by redirecting the rest of your app to the wrapped version:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"std:kv-storage\": \"/js/als-wrapper.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/js/als-wrapper.mjs\": {\n      \"std:kv-storage\": \"std:kv-storage\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis first ensures that in general, `\"std:kv-storage\"` resolves to `/js/als-wrapper.mjs`, but that for the particular scope of the `/js/als-wrapper.mjs` file itself, the resolution behaves as normal. This allows us to write the wrapper file like so:\n\n```js\nimport instrument from \"/js/utils/instrumenter.mjs\";\nimport { storage as orginalStorage, StorageArea as OriginalStorageArea } from \"std:kv-storage\";\n\nexport const storage = instrument(originalStorage);\nexport const StorageArea = instrument(OriginalStorageArea);\n```\n\nNow, whenever any part of our app (except the wrapper module itself) imports `\"std:kv-storage\"`, it will resolve to the wrapper module, giving the wrapped and instrumented exports.\n\n#### Extending a built-in module\n\nThe story for extending a built-in module is very similar as for wrapping. For example, let's say that KV storage gained a new export, `SuperAwesomeStorageArea`. We would use the same import map as in the previous example, and just change our wrapper like so:\n\n```js\nexport { storage, StorageArea } from \"std:kv-storage\";\nexport class SuperAwesomeStorageArea { ... };\n```\n\n(Note: if we just wanted to add a new method to `StorageArea`, there's no need for a wrapper module or a import map. We would just include a polyfill module that imported `StorageArea` and patched a new method onto `StorageArea.prototype`.)\n\nThis same principle would apply for removing exports, if for some reason that was desirable.\n\n## `import:` URLs\n\nAs a supplement to the base import map concept, we introduce the new `import:` URL scheme. This scheme allows easier access to \"packaged\" resources from within HTML, CSS, or other URL-accepting parts of the platform such as `fetch()`.\n\n### A widget package example\n\nConsider a UI widget, distributed under the \"package name\" `widget`. It contains not only a JavaScript module, but also CSS themes, and corresponding images. You could configure a import map like\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"widget\": \"/node_modules/widget/index.mjs\",\n    \"widget/\": \"/node_modules/widget/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand then do\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"import:widget/themes/light.css\">\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"import:widget\"></script>\n```\n\nor\n\n```css\n.back-button {\n  background: url('import:widget/assets/back.svg');\n}\n```\n\nThis brings the name-coordination benefits of JavaScript's bare import specifiers (i.e., npm-style packages) to all web resources.\n\n### A data file package example\n\nConsider a package of JSON data, for example [the timezone database](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tzdata). Similar to the above, you could configure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"tzdata\": \"/node_modules/tzdata/timezone-data.json\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand then write JavaScript code that did\n\n```js\nconst data = await (await fetch('import:tzdata')).json();\n```\n\n### URL resolution semantics\n\nExactly how `import:` URLs are resolved is still somewhat vague: in particular, what \"referrer URL\" is used for the purposes of:\n\n- Resolving relative specifiers, such as in `import:./foo`\n- Deciding which scope to use when consulting the realm's import map.\n\nThe first of these is not a big deal, as the corresponding use cases are not terribly important anyway. But the second is important. Consider a case where most of your app can use v2 of `widget`, but one of your third-party dependencies (call it `gadget`) needs to get v1, because it depends on the previous API contract. You would generally handle this via an import map like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"widget\": \"/node_modules/widget-v2/index.mjs\",\n    \"widget/\": \"/node_modules/widget-v2/\"\n  },\n  \"scopes\": {\n    \"/node_modules/gadget/\": {\n      \"widget\": \"/node_modules/widget-v1/index.mjs\",\n      \"widget/\": \"/node_modules/widget-v1/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe question is then, inside `/node_modules/gadget/styles.css`, how does\n\n```css\n.back-button {\n  background: url(import:widget/back-button.svg);\n}\n```\n\nresolve? The desired answer is to resolve to the corresponding v1 URL, i.e. `/node_modules/widget-v1/back-button.svg`.\n\nOur current tentative proposal is that the referrer URL for `import:` fetches be determined by using the request's referrer URL. In practice, this will mean:\n\n- By default, use \"the page's base URL\" (in spec terms: the fetch client's API base URL)\n- If the fetch is from a CSS file, use the CSS file's URL (in spec terms: its [location](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#concept-css-style-sheet-location); see [Referrer Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/#integration-with-css))\n- If the fetch is from a [HTML module](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/html-module-spec-changes.md), use the module's base URL (not yet specified)\n\nNote how the default choice here makes things still a bit fragile, when used from JavaScript source files. Consider code inside `/node_modules/gadget/index.mjs`:\n\n```js\nconst link = document.createElement('link');\nlink.rel = 'stylesheet';\nlink.href = 'import:widget/themes/light.css';\ndocument.head.append(link);\n```\n\nThis code will not behave as desired; the URL of the stylesheet that is fetched will be `/node_modules/widget-v2/themes/light.css`, instead of the counterpart v1 URL.\n\nThe proposed solution is that we should instead provide an `import.meta.resolve()` function, which (like `import()` or `import` statements) works relative to the active script URL. Then you could write\n\n```js\nconst link = document.createElement('link');\nlink.rel = 'stylesheet';\nlink.href = import.meta.resolve('widget/themes/light.css');\ndocument.head.append(link);\n```\n\nHowever, this gets a little complicated due to the [fallbacks for user-supplied packages](#for-user-supplied-packages) feature; see discussion in [#79](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/79).\n\n_Previous versions of this proposal anticipated making `import:` URLs resolve relative to the current active script. However, that has intractible problems, as discussed in [#75](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/75)._\n\n\n## Import map processing\n\n### Installation\n\n_The below represents a tentative idea. See the issue tracker for more discussion and alternatives: [#1](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/1)._\n\nYou can install an import map for your application using a `<script>` element, either inline (for best performance) or with a `src=\"\"` attribute (in which case you'd better be using HTTP/2 push to get that thing to us as soon as possible):\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n{\n  \"imports\": { ... },\n  \"scopes\": { ... }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\" src=\"import-map.json\"></script>\n```\n\nBecause they affect all imports, any import maps must be present and successfully fetched before any module resolution is done. This means that module graph fetching, or any fetching of `import:` URLs, is blocked on import map fetching.\n\nSimilarly, attempting to add a new `<script type=\"importmap\">` after any module graph fetching, or fetching of `import:` URLs, has started, is an error. The import map will be ignored, and the `<script>` element will fire an error.\n\nMultiple `<script type=\"importmap\">`s are allowed on the page. (See previous discussion in [#14](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/14).) They are merged by an intentionally-simple procedure, roughly equivalent to the JavaScript code\n\n```js\nconst result = {\n  imports: { ...a.imports, ...b.imports },\n  scopes: { ...a.scopes, ...b.scopes }\n};\n```\n\nSee [the proto-spec](./spec.md) for more details on how this all works.\n\n_What do we do in workers? Probably `new Worker(someURL, { type: \"module\", importMap: ... })`? Or should you set it from inside the worker? Should dedicated workers use their controlling document's map, either by default or always? Discuss in [#2](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/2)._\n\n### Dynamic import map example\n\nThe above rules mean that you _can_ dynamically generate import maps, as long as you do so before performing any imports. For example:\n\n```html\n<script>\nconst im = document.createElement('script');\nim.type = 'importmap';\nim.textContent = JSON.stringify({\n  imports: {\n    'my-library': Math.random() > 0.5 ? '/my-awesome-library.mjs' : '/my-rad-library.mjs';\n  }\n});\ndocument.currentScript.after(im);\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport 'my-library'; // will fetch the randomly-chosen URL\n</script>\n```\n\nA more realistic example might use this capability to override a previous import map based on feature detection:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"lodash\": \"/lodash.mjs\",\n    \"moment\": \"/moment.mjs\"\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<script>\nif (!someFeatureDetection()) {\n  const im = document.createElement('script');\n  im.type = 'importmap';\n  im.textContent = '{ \"imports\": { \"lodash\": \"/lodash-legacy-browsers.js\" } }';\n  document.currentScript.after(im);\n}\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport _ from \"lodash\"; // will fetch the right URL for this browser\n</script>\n```\n\nNote that (like other `<script>` elements) modifying the contents of a `<script type=\"importmap\">` after it's already inserted in the document will not work; this is why we wrote the above example by inserting a second `<script type=\"importmap\">` to overwrite the first one.\n\n### Scope\n\nImport maps are an application-level thing, somewhat like service workers. (More formally, they would be per-module map, and thus per-realm.) They are not meant to be composed, but instead produced by a human or tool with a holistic view of your web application. For example, it would not make sense for a library to include a import map; libraries can simply reference modules by specifier, and let the application decide what URLs those specifiers map to.\n\nThis, in addition to general simplicity, is in part what motivates the above restrictions on `<script type=\"importmap\">`.\n\nSince an application's import map changes the resolution algorithm for every module in the module map, they are not impacted by whether a module's source text was originally from a cross-origin URL. If you load a module from a CDN that uses bare import specifiers, you'll need to know ahead of time what bare import specifiers that module adds to your app, and include them in your application's import map. (That is, you need to know what all of your application's transitive dependencies are.) It's important that control of which URLs are use for each package stay with the application author, so they can holistically manage versioning and sharing of modules.\n\n## Alternatives considered\n\n### The Node.js module resolution algorithm\n\nUnlike in Node.js, in the browser we don't have the luxury of a reasonably-fast file system that we can crawl looking for modules. Thus, we cannot implement the [Node module resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders) directly; it would require performing multiple server round-trips for every `import` statement, wasting bandwidth and time as we continue to get 404s. We need to ensure that every `import` statement causes only one HTTP request; this necessitates some measure of precomputation.\n\n### A programmable resolution hook\n\nSome have suggested customizing the browser's module resolution algorithm using a JavaScript hook to interpret each module specifier.\n\nUnfortunately, this is fatal to performance; jumping into and back out of JavaScript for every edge of a module graph drastically slows down application startup. (Typical web applications have on the order of thousands of modules, with 3-4× that many import statements.) You can imagine various mitigations, such as restricting the calls to only bare import specifiers or requiring that the hook take batches of specifiers and return batches of URLs, but in the end nothing beats precomputation.\n\nAnother issue with this is that it's hard to imagine a useful mapping algorithm a web developer could write, even if they were given this hook. Node.js has one, but it is based on repeatedly crawling the filesystem and checking if files exist; we as discussed above, that's infeasible on the web. The only situation in which a general algorithm would be feasible is if (a) you never needed per-subgraph customization, i.e. only one version of every module existed in your application; (b) tooling managed to arrange your modules ahead of time in some uniform, predictable fashion, so that e.g. the algorithm becomes \"return `/js/${specifier}.js`\". But if we're in this world anyway, a declarative solution would be simpler.\n\n### Ahead-of-time rewriting\n\nOne solution in use today (e.g. in the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) CDN via [babel-plugin-unpkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-unpkg)) is to rewrite all bare import specifiers to their appropriate absolute URLs ahead of time, using build tooling. This could also be done at install time, so that when you install a package using npm, it automatically rewrites the package's contents to use absolute or relative URLs instead of bare import specifiers.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it does not work with dynamic `import()`, as it's impossible to statically analyze the strings passed to that function. You could inject a fixup that, e.g., changes every instance of `import(x)` into `import(specifierToURL(x, import.meta.url))`, where `specifierToURL` is another function generated by the build tool. But in the end this is a fairly leaky abstraction, and the `specifierToURL` function largely duplicates the work of this proposal anyway.\n\n### Service workers\n\nAt first glance, service workers seem like the right place to do this sort of resource translation. We've talked in the past about finding some way to pass the specifier along with a service worker's fetch event, thus allowing it to give back an appropriate `Response`.\n\nHowever, _service workers are not available on first load_. Thus, they can't really be a part of the critical infrastructure used to load modules. They can only be used as a progressive enhancement on top of fetches that will otherwise generally work.\n\n### A convention-based flat mapping\n\nIf you have a simple applications with no need for scoped dependency resolution, and have a package installation tool which is comfortable rewriting paths on disk inside the package (unlike current versions of npm), you could get away with a much simpler mapping. For example, if your installation tool created a flat listing of the form\n\n```\nnode_modules_flattened/\n  lodash/\n    index.js\n    core.js\n    fp.js\n  moment/\n    index.js\n  html-to-dom/\n    index.js\n```\n\nthen the only information you need is\n\n- A base URL (in our app, `/node_modules_flattened/`)\n- The main module filename used (in our app, `index.js`)\n\nYou could imagine a module import configuration format that only specified these things, or even only some subset (if we baked in assumptions for the others).\n\nThis idea does not work for more complex applications which need scoped resolution, so we believe the full import map proposal is necessary. But it remains attractive for simple applications, and we wonder if there's a way to make the proposal also have an easy-mode that does not require listing all modules, but instead relies on conventions and tools to ensure minimal mapping is needed. Discuss in [#7](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/7).\n\n## Adjacent concepts\n\n### Supplying out-of-band metadata for each module\n\nSeveral times now it's come up that people desire to supply metadata for each module; for example, [integrity metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity), or fetching options. Although some have proposed doing this with an import statement, [careful consideration of the options](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qfoLTniLUVJ5YNFrha7BaVumAnW0ZgcCfUU8UbyyuYY/edit#slide=id.p) leads to preferring an out-of-band manifest file.\n\nThe import map _could_ be that manifest file. However, it may not be the best fit, for a few reasons:\n\n- As currently envisioned, most modules in an application would not have entries in the import map. The main use case is for modules you need to refer to by bare specifiers, or modules where you need to do something tricky like polyfilling or virtualizing. If we envisioned every module being in the map, we would not include convenience features like packages-via-trailing-slashes.\n\n- All proposed metadata so far is applicable to any sort of resource, not just JavaScript modules. A solution should probably work at a more general level.\n\n### Alternating logic based on the presence of a built-in module\n\n_See further discussion of this case in the issue tracker: [#61](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/61)._\n\nNot all fallbacks take the role of running one piece of code. For example, sometimes, one code path is to be taken if a particular platform API exists, and another code path is taken if it doesn't exist. The import maps proposal does not aim to solve all such scenarios in a built-in way; instead, the stage 2 TC39 proposal [top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await) can be used to meet some of these use cases.\n\nImagine if IndexedDB were provided by a built-in module `std:indexed-db` and localStorage were provided by a built-in module `std:local-storage`. For a particular application, all supported browsers support localStorage, and only some support IndexedDB. Although it's possible to polyfill IndexedDB on top of localStorage, in this scenario, doing so leads to performance overhead vs more specialized usage. Therefore, it's preferrable to use a specialized implementation based on either IndexedDB or localStorage directly, instead of using import maps to remap `std:indexed-db`.\n\nIn this scenario, a module may use top-level await to perform feature testing and fallback as follows:\n\n```js\nexport let myStorageFunction;\n\ntry {\n  const indexedDB = await import(\"std:indexed-db\");\n  myStorageFunction = function() { /* in terms of indexedDB */ };\n} catch (e) {\n  const localStorage = await import(\"std:local-storage\");\n  myStorageFunction = function() { /* in terms of localStorage */ };\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation notes\n\n### `import:` URL staging\n\nThe `import:` URL feature is ambitious in that it involves cross-cutting implementation work that goes outside of the usual \"module loading\" pipeline, and starts affecting network code.\n\nWe believe `import:` URLs are valuable, and solve a real developer need. They were a [prominent feature request](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/23) against earlier versions of this proposal. We believe that having a proposal that incorporates them is better than trying to tack them on later.\n\nThat said, in terms of implementation staging, it's easy to slice this proposal into a \"without `import:` URLs\" implementation that later gets followed by a \"with `import:` URLs\" implementation. Simply by making import maps only affect `import` statements and `import()` expressions at first, an implementation can deliver much of the value, and later work on the `import:` URL implementation.\n\n### Further implementation staging\n\nSpeaking of delivering incremental value, it's worth noting that by even before getting to `import:` URLs, implementations can ship subsets of the proposal that solve important use cases. For example, one implementation plan could be:\n\n- Only support map entries of the form `\"http(s) URL\": [\"built-in module\", \"same http(s) URL\"]`. ([See above](#for-built-in-modules-in-module-import-map-supporting-browsers) for a realistic example.) This enables built-in module polyfilling in a backward-compatible way.\n- Support general URL and non-array addresses in the specifier map. This enables basic bare import specifier support.\n- Support scoping. This enables full \"npm parity\" bare import specifier support.\n- Support fallbacks from HTTP(S) URLs to HTTP(S) URLs. This allows supplanting the [terrible `document.write()`-using sync-script-loading hacks](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CDNsFailButYourScriptsDontHaveToFallbackFromCDNToLocalJQuery.aspx).\n\n### `import:` URL loads and origins\n\nParticular questions come up around whether `import:` URLs can be used for navigations or worker loads. In these cases, the origin of such URLs would become important. Some potential answers:\n\n- These URLs cannot be used for navigations or workers\n- These URLs can be used for navigations or workers, but have an opaque origin\n- These URLs can be used for navigations or workers, and have an origin derived from where they resolve to.\n\nWe can easily start by disallowing such uses of `import:` URLs, and expanding to one of the other two options later.\n\n### `import:` URL interaction with other loading infrastructure\n\nSeveral implementer questions come up around how `import:` URLs are envisioned to interact with other loading infrastructure, for example service workers. Initial attempts to answer these sorts of questions are in [the proto-spec](./spec.md).\n\nThe high-level summary is that any fetch of an `import:` URL should be thought of as sugar for a series of if-then-else statements that in turn fetch the mapped-to URLs. For example, each fetch will pass through the service worker, until one succeeds.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis document originated out of a day-long sprint involving [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic), [@hiroshige-g](https://github.com/hiroshige-g), [@justinfagnani](https://github.com/justinfagnani), [@MylesBorins](https://github.com/MylesBorins), and [@nyaxt](https://github.com/nyaxt).

            "text": "# `intrinsicsize` Attribute on Media Elements Explainer\n\nThere’s no way to do media that maintains aspect ratio, is proportional to the width of the screen, and doesn’t cause a user visible reflow. If we provide a way for the author to declare the intrinsic size of the image before the image has loaded, then we could allow them to specify just one dimension (e.g. the width) to a percentage or pixel value and compute the other dimension immediately without waiting for the image to load.\n\nOne edge case to keep in mind is when you want an image to size to its container, but the image is sometimes smaller than its container. In that case, the desired behavior is to have the image be its intrinsic size instead of stretching it.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nAdd an `intrinsicsize` attribute: \n\n```HTML\n<img intrinsicsize=\"400x300\" style=\"width: 100%\">`.\n```\n\nThe `intrinsicsize` attribute tells the browser override the actual intrinsic size of the image with the width/height specified in the `intrinsicsize` attribute. Specifically, the image rasters at these dimensions and [naturalWidth/naturalHeight](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dom-img-naturalwidth) on images would return the values specified in this attribute. \n\nOn video elements, the video would raster at this size and the [videoWidth/videoHeight](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-video-videowidth) on the video would return the value of the `intrinsicsize` attribute.\n\nAll other image size operations behave the same. So, for example:\n\n* If no width/height are otherwise set, then the image dimensions are those specified by 'intrinsicsize'.\n* If the `width` attribute is set on the image, then `intrinsicsize` would set the height to maintain the aspect ratio.\n* If `width` and `height` attributes are both on the image, then `intrinsicsize` attribute’s value only affects the values of `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight`, but not the rendered size of the image.\n\nThe sizes are in CSS Pixels.\n\nThis attribute applies on all image element types (including SVG images) and videos.\n\n## FAQ\n* **Why just image and video?** These are the only elements in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#elements-3 that size to an external resource.\n\n* **How does this relate to the `unsized-media` policy?** The idea behind the [unsized-media feature policy](https://github.com/WICG/feature-policy/issues/127) is to have a mode for the web where images don’t cause a reflow when the image data loads. This policy achieves that goal, but at the cost of making it extremely difficult to have images whose width is proportional to the size of their container and/or the screen while maintaining the aspect ratio. This proposal couples nicely with `unsized-media` in that it’s another way to set a size on an image/video. The unsized media policy just overrides the intrinsic size of the media element to be `300x150`. This lets authors override what that value should be.\n\n* **How does this work with responsive images?** The `intrinsicsize` attribute sets the image's intrinsic aspect ratio. For an image element with a `srcset`, if:\n    + a source is chosen using the `w` descriptor, then the result of evaluating the `sizes` attribute sets the image's intrinsic width, and its intrinsic height will be calculated by the intrinsic aspect ratio defined by `intrinsicsize` attribute;\n    + otherwise, the `intrinsicsize` attribute sets the intrinsic width and the intrinsic height.\n\n## Open questions\n* **Does this let you do aspect-ratio for responsive layout videos or does that need an additional solution?** Aspect ratio on videos can be achieved in [terribly painful ways](https://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video) today and [generally on any element](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/).\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n### aspectratio attribute\n`<img aspectratio=\"400x300\" style=\"width: 100%\">`\n\n* **Pro**: Simple to understand and implement\n* **Con**:  Doesn't work for a common use case, where you want to constrain an image to be no bigger than its container, but not stretch it to be larger. That is, you want to set the image's width to min(width of container, intrinsic width of image), and you want to do so before downloading any image data.\n\n#### Details\nUsing `intrinsicsize=\"\"`, you can accomplish this like so:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"width: 75vw\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" intrinsicsize=\"400x300\" style=\"max-width: 100%\">\n</div>\n```\n\nThis gives the browser enough information to figure out the image's size, which will (correctly) end up as min(400px, 75vw), even before downloading any image data.\n\nBut if you tried to do this using `aspectratio=\"\"`, there's no way for the 400 pixel measurement to enter the system. E.g. given:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"width: 75vw\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" aspectratio=\"4x3\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n</div>\n```\n\nThe width will be `75vw` always, which is incorrect. Or if the author does:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"width: 75vw\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" aspectratio=\"4x3\" style=\"max-width: 100%\">\n</div>\n```\n\nThen the width will be correct eventually, but only after the image downloads; until then the browser doesn't know whether it should be `75vw`, or something less.\n\n### width/height set the intrinsic size, New override attribute\n\n```html\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"300\" actualwidth=\"100%\">\n```\n\n* Con: Doesn’t work with CSS or would need to also add a CSS property\n* Con: Makes width/height mean something different than it does today. Not really backwards compatible.\n\n### width/height set the intrinsic size, New override attribute\n\n```html\n<img intrinsicwidth=\"400\" intrinsicheight=\"300\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n```\n\n* **Pro**: Allows you to only override one of width or height from the default of 300x150. Not clear this is really a pro. Is it useful to set only one dimension of the intrinsic size?\n* **Con**: Requires setting two properties\n"

            "text": "# JavaScript Self-Profiling API Proposal\n\n[Slides from TPAC 2018](https://github.com/vdjeric/js-self-profiling/blob/master/doc/tpac-2018-slides.pdf)\n\n[Draft spec](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling)\n\nDiscussion in GitHub issues + [WICG discourse thread](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-an-api-to-allow-webpage-javascript-to-profile-its-own-performance/2818)\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently it is difficult for web developers to understand how their applications perform in the wide variety of conditions encountered on real user devices. A programmable JS profiling API is needed to collect JS profiles from real end-user environments.\n\nA native self-profiling API for JS code would also allow web developers to efficiently find hotspots in their JS code during page loads and user interactions, to assign CPU budgets to individual JS-implemented features on the page, to find unnecessary work being done on the client, and to find low-priority JS code executing in the background and wasting device power.\n\nCurrently JS self-profiling can be accomplished by instrumenting individual JS functions with timing code but this is cumbersome, bloats JS size, changes the code (potentially altering performance characteristics), adds overhead from timing calls, and risks missing out on hotspots in unexpected corners.\n\n## Facebook's Profiler Polyfill\n\nIn an attempt to polyfill the missing self-profiling functionality, Facebook built and deployed its own in-page JS profiler implemented with JavaScript and SharedArrayBuffers. This JS profiler was implemented using a worker thread that signaled to the main thread when it needed to record its current stack. The worker thread would toggle a “capture stack now” flag in a SharedArrayBuffer every few milliseconds, and the value of this flag was read by instrumentation code that was inserted at transpilation time into the beginning of interesting JS functions running on the main thread. If the instrumentation code saw that the flag was set, it would capture the current JS stack (using the Error object) and add it to the running profile.\n\nThis JS profiler was enabled for only a small percentage of Facebook users, and only instrumented functions of 10 statements or more in order to limit performance impact and to limit the quantity of profiling data collected. Nevertheless, we found it extremely valuable for understanding Facebook.com's performance in the field and for finding optimization opportunities. \n\nThis polyfill implementation had some downsides:\n\n* The size overhead of the added instrumentation required limiting the fraction of functions instrumented (resulting in incomplete coverage)\n* The sampling “interrupt” was not instant so stacks were collected from the **_next_** instrumented function which added a lot of noise to the dataset and made it difficult to reason about\n* The performance overhead limited the sampling frequency and fraction of pageloads profiled\n* Our design depended on SharedArrayBuffers, which have been disabled on the Web for the time-being, so the profiler is disabled for now\n\nA browser-implemented profiling API would avoid these downsides.\n\n## Wider Industry Interest\n\nIt is cumbersome to manage instrumentation for performance measurement, regardless of whether it is inserted by build-time tooling (like Facebook's polyfill above) or inserted by hand in functions of interest. This API eliminates the need to maintain performance instrumentation and therefore allows smaller sites to deploy in-page JS profiling.\n\nWe also expect that third-party analytics providers will offer libraries or infrastructure to record, ingest, aggregate and automatically analyze the collected profiles for optimization opportunities, thus further lowering the barrier to entry.\n\nFinally, several other Web properties with large codebases have expressed interest to us for using this API to better monitor their webapps performance in the field.\n\n## API Overview\n\nDevelopers will be able to spin up a new `profiler` via `performance.profile(options)`, where `options` contains the following required fields:\n\n- Target sample rate\n- Maximum sample capacity\n- Call frame categories that should be traced (currently only \"js\")\n\nThe returned `profiler` (wrapped in a promise) will begin sampling. The UA may choose a different sample rate than the one that the user requested (which must be the next lowest valid sampling interval), or it may refuse to spin up a profiler for any reason (e.g. if there are too many profilers running concurrently) by rejecting the promise. The true sample rate of the profiler may be accessible via `profiler.options.sampleInterval`.\n\nEach time the sampling interval has elapsed, the following algorithm is run:\n\n1. Let `env` be the script execution environment of the script that started the profiler.\n2. Let `stack` be the stack of execution contexts associated with `env`.\n3. For each execution context `ec` on `stack`:\n    1. Let `ecs` be the script associated with `ec`.\n    2. If the realm associated with `ecs` does not match the realm that created the profiler, omit the stack frame.\n    3. If the source of the classic script tag associated with `ecs` shares an origin with the browsing context or has the `crossorigin` bit set (and it sends a valid CORS header), record the stack frame.\n    4. If the source of the module script tag associated with `ecs` sends a valid CORS header, record the stack frame.\n    5. Otherwise, omit the stack frame.\n4. Report a new sample with all stack frames recorded in the algorithm, associated with the current timestamp relative to the browsing context's time origin.\n\n    _In a nutshell, this collects data from all stack frames that come from a script that is same-origin or participates in CORS, masking those that do not._\n\nThe UA is free to elide any stack frames that may be optimized out (e.g. as a result of inlining).\n\nCalling `profiler.stop()` returns a promise containing a trace object that can be sent to a server for aggregation. This trace is encoded in a trie format similar to the GeckoProfiler and Chrome tracing formats.\n\nIf the sample buffer capacity is reached, the `onsamplebufferfull` event is sent to the `profiler` object. This stops profiling immediately. The trace may still be collected via `profiler.stop()` when this occurs.\n\n## Privacy and Security\n\nThe primary concern with profiling JavaScript running on an event loop shared\nby multiple browsing contexts is ensuring that stack frames from cross-origin\nbrowsing contexts are not leaked. The spec aims to avoid the leakage of such\nframes by utilizing a ECMA-262 realm-based filtering approach, allowing\nisolation of frames in profiling sessions to a single realm / frame to comply\nwith the same-origin policy.\n\nAnother concern is the leaking of function names from foreign-origin scripts,\nwhich wouldn't normally be accessible without the resource participating in\nCORS. The spec aims to mitigate this by only including such foreign-origin\nfunctions if the resource that contains them passes a CORS check. For classic\nscripts, this means that functions are only included in traces if the\n`crossorigin` bit traditionally used for uncensoring `Error.stack` contents is\npresent in the associated script tag, and the scripts passes a CORS check.\n\nAs with any API that exposes accurate timing information, timing side-channel\nattacks are a risk. We are not aware of any new timing attacks enabled by this\nspec, but further analysis is necessary.\n\n## Profile Format\n\nSpace-efficient encodings are possible given the tree-like structure of profile stacks and the repeated strings in function names and filenames. A trie seems like a natural choice. A trie is also desirable because the raw uncompressed memory representation causes huge memory pressure and is more expensive to analyze (e.g. to count stack frequencies).\n\nThere are examples of trie-based approaches in browsers today:\n\n* [Chrome's Trace Event format, specifically the stackFrames field](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview#heading=h.yr703knxre9f)\n* [Firefox's Gecko Profiler format, specifically the stackTable field](https://github.com/devtools-html/perf.html/blob/master/docs-developer/gecko-profile-format.md#source-data-format)\n\nThus, we propose the following trie-based trace format, to be returned as either a standard JS dictionary or in a gzipped representation depending on the `format` argument (see spec).\n\n```javascript\n{\n   \"stacks\" : [\n      {\n         \"frameId\" : 0\n      },\n      {\n         \"frameId\" : 1,\n         \"parentId\" : 0\n      },\n      {\n         \"frameId\" : 2,\n         \"parentId\" : 1\n      },\n   ],\n   \"samples\" : [\n      {\n         \"timestamp\" : 1551.73499998637,\n         \"stackId\": 2\n      },\n      {\n         \"timestamp\" : 1576.83999999426,\n         \"stackId\": 1,\n      },\n      {\n         \"timestamp\" : 1601.90499993041\n      },\n   ],\n   \"frames\" : [\n      {\n         \"category\" : \"js\",\n         \"name\" : \"b\",\n         \"uri\" : \"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yW/r/ZgaPtFDHPeq.js\",\n         \"line\" : 23,\n         \"column\" : 169,\n      },\n      {\n         \"category\" : \"js\",\n         \"name\" : \"l\",\n         \"uri\" : \"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3iMKu4/yW/l/en_US-i/gSq3sO3PcU1.js\",\n         \"line\" : 313,\n         \"column\" : 468,\n      },\n      {\n         \"category\" : \"js\",\n         \"uri\" : \"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3iMKu4/yW/l/en_US-i/gSq3sO3PcU1.js\",\n         \"line\" : 313,\n         \"name\" : \"a\",\n         \"column\" : 1325\n      },\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n## Visualization\n\nMozilla's perf.html visualization tool for Firefox profiles or Chrome's trace-viewer (chrome://tracing) UI could be trivially adapted to visualize the data produced by this profiling API.\n\n## perf.html\n\nAs an illustration, a screenshot below from Mozilla's perf.html project shows the JS stack aggregation and timeline. It is able to show gaps where JavaScript was not executing, areas where there were long running events (red), and an aggregate view of the samples in the selected time range such as the 15 contiguous samples in function 'user.ts' highlighted in the screenshot below.\n\n![Mozilla's perf.html UI for visualizing Gecko profiles](perf.html.png)\n\n"

            "text": "# Element Timing for Images: Explainer\n\nnpm@, tdresser@\n\nThe **Element Timing** API enables monitoring when large or developer-specified image elements are displayed on screen.\n\n\n### Objectives\n\n1.  Inform developers when specific 'hero' elements are first displayed on the screen. To keep the first version of this API simpler and have an easier path towards standardization, we restrict to image elements: \\<img\\>, \\<image\\> inside \\<svg\\>, and background-images. Web developers can better understand which are the critical images of their sites, so after annotating them the browser can provide timing information about those elements.\n1.  Enable analytics providers to measure display time of key images, without explicit opt in from web developers. In many cases it's not feasible for developers to modify their HTML just to get better performance insights, so it's important to provide basic information even for websites that cannot annotate their elements.\n\n\n### How do we register images for observation?\n\nThere are two ways an image can be registered for observation: via an HTML attribute and when the image takes a large portion of the viewport when it is first displayed. For background-image: when it affects the style of an element which has the HTML attribute, then all of the images from that background-image are registered for observation (since background-image can include multiple URLs, multiple images may be registered for observation).\n\n#### Attributes\n\nWhen an element with the 'elementtiming' attribute is added to the DOM, it will be observed if it is an image, and its background-images will be observed if it has them. It should be noted that setting the 'elementtiming' attribute does not work retroactively: once an element has loaded and is rendered, setting the attribute will have no effect. Thus, it is strongly encouraged to set the attribute before the element is added to the document (in HTML, or if set on Javascript, before adding it to the document).\n\n#### Implicit registration of large image elements\n\nWe register a subset of HTML images by default to allow RUM analytics providers to gather information without having to request HTML changes from sites. We use images that occupy a large percentage of the viewport upon being rendered. In particular, upon rendering, we register images that occupy a significant percentage of the viewport (say 15% as a placeholder, exact value TBD).\n\n### What information is exposed?\n\na PerformanceElementTiming entry has the following relevant attributes:\n* |name|: the initial URL for the resource request.\n* |startTime|: the rendering timestamp.\n* |intersectionRect|: the display rectangle of the image within the viewport.\n* |responseEnd|: the timestamp of when the last byte of the resource response was received, same as ResourceTiming's [responseEnd](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-responseend).\n\nSample code:\n\n```\n<img src=\"my_image.jpg\" elementtiming=\"foobar\">\n\nconst observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {\n  let perfEntries = list.getEntries().forEach(function(entry) {\n      // Send the information to analytics, or in this case just log it to console.\n      // |entry.startTime| contains the timestamp of when the image is displayed.\n      console.log(\"My image took \" + entry.startTime + \" to render!\");\n   });\n});\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: ['element']});\n```\n\n#### Origin restrictions\n\nAllowing third-party origins to measure the time an arbitrary image resource takes to render could expose certain private content such as whether a user is logged into a website. Therefore, for privacy and security reasons, only rendering timing for entries corresponding to resources that pass the [timing allow check](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dfn-timing-allow-check) are exposed.\n\nHowever, to enable a more holistic picture, the rest of the information is exposed for arbitrary images. That is, its |startTime| will be 0 but the other attributes will be set as described above.\n\n### Questions\n\n#### What about occluded elements?\n\nThe entry creation will not be based strictly on _visibility_: for instance if the element is there, but hidden by a full-screen pop-up on the page, or is the style visibility is set to none, or the opacity is 0.\n\n"

            "text": "# isInputPending\n\n## The Problem\nToday, developers must tradeoff how fast they can accomplish large blocks of\nwork and how responsive they are to user input. For example, during page load,\nthere may be a set of components and scripts to initialize. These are often\nordered by priority: for example, first installing event handlers on primary\nbuttons, then a search box, then a messaging widget, and then finally moving on\nto analytics scripts and ads.\n\nIn this example, a developer can either optimize for:\n* Completing all work as fast as possible.\n  * For example, we want the messaging widget to be initialized by the time the\n    user interacts with it.\n* Responding to user input as fast as possible.\n  * For example, when the user taps one of our primary buttons, we don't want to\n    block until our whole page is ready to go before responding.\n\nCompleting all work as fast as possible is easy, the developer can simply\nexecute all the work in the minimal number of tasks.\n\nResponding to user input as fast as possible today requires paying some\nperformance overhead, and minimizing that performance overhead is quite\ncomplicated. The most straight forward approach is to perform a unit of work,\nand then `setTimeout(..., 0)` or `setImmediate(...)` to continue the work.\n\nThe performance overhead of this approach comes from a few sources:\n* Inherent overhead in posting a task.\n* Task throttling from the browser.\n* Execution of other browser work, such as rendering, postponing task execution.\n  * Sometimes this is desirable, to get something visible on screen sooner. If\n    we're executing script which is required to display our app however, this\n    isn't desirable.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIn order to enable developers to complete their work as fast as possible if the\nuser isn't interacting, but respond to user input as fast as possible if input\noccurs, we propose adding a new `navigator.scheduling.isInputPending()` API, which takes an array of input event types and returns true\nif any of them might be pending. If called with no arguments (or an empty array), true is returned if input of _any_ type might be pending. To avoid script from misbehaving user agents will also be allowed to sometimes return true for whatever arbitrary reasons it wants.\n\n## Example\n\nUsing `scheduling.isInputPending()` requires having some way to schedule tasks. We anticipate\nmost adoption coming from frameworks and large sites. However, if you have a\nlist of tasks that need executing, adoption is very simple.\n\n```javascript\nlet taskQueue = [task1, task2, ...];\n\nfunction doWork() {\n  while (let task = taskQueue.pop()) {\n    task.execute();\n    if (navigator.scheduling.isInputPending(['click', 'keydown', ...])) {\n      setTimeout(doWork, 0);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ndoWork();\n```\n\n## What about `requestIdleCallback`?\n`requestIdleCallback` has the capacity to solve similar problems, but only when the work being done is low priority. It waits for an idle period before executing the associated work. In the example of registering behavior for a variety of UI components, we can't wait for an idle period before continuing to register additional UI components.\n\nWe could use an API shape similar to `requestIdleCallback`, which instead posted a normal priority task, and provided a parallel to `IdleDeadline.timeRemaining()` which returned 0 if there was pending user input. However, this forces clients to use a specific method of posting a task, which is less flexible than the more generic `scheduling.isInputPending()` proposal.\n\n## How slow is posting a task, really?\n\nBreaking tasks up into small chunks has some overhead, but is it really enough to warrant a new API?\n\nThe web is different from most platforms due to it's compositional nature. The overhead of posting a task isn't merely the scheduling overhead. Posting a task may involve being interrupted by arbitrary third party content on the page. For many pages, it isn't feasible to regularly yield to third party script in order to repond to input quickly.\n\n## Constraints\n\nIdeally, a solution to this problem would meet the following constraints:\n1. Enable stopping JS execution when input arrives.\n1. Enable efficiently resuming JS execution once input has been processed.\n1. Provide the browser a way to stop the JS from executing when input isn’t\n   pending, in case the browser decides it really needs to draw something.\n1. Not require paying the cost of posting a task unless the browser has\n   pending high priority work\n1. Prevent other JS from running between when the script stops and resumes JS\n   execution\n   * This excludes JS associated with browser work like event processing, rAF\n     callbacks etc\n\nThis proposal focuses on constraints 1, 3 & 4, and ignores 2 and 5, which will\nbe addressed independently.\n\nThe fifth constraint is interesting - in order for work which is incentivized to\nfinish quickly (e.g., ads script) to be able to adopt this API and improve\nresponsiveness to input, we need some way to prevent arbitrary javascript from\nexecuting between when script yields and when it is rescheduled.\n\n## Privacy and Security\n\nThe primary concerns with this API stem from the correctness of input event attribution. UAs must make sure they don't leak information about pending events dispatched to other frames by performing necessary hit-testing and focus attribution. For maximum utility, this should be done off the event loop so that running JS does not have to yield in order to detect input.\n\nUser agents may want consider a combination of off-main-thread based hit testing (e.g. done on the compositor thread, if present) and keyboard focus to determine the appropriate document to mark as having input pending. By performing hit testing online, calls to isInputPending can be made faster, safer from timing attacks, and thus more effective for scheduling purposes.\n"

            "text": "# Display Locking\n\nThis is a short proposal for Display Locking. For more details, see the\n[explainer](https://github.com/WICG/display-locking/blob/master/explainer.md).\n\n### Problem\n\nWebsites frequently rely on dynamic content to present information. This means\nthat DOM is often manipulated using script to present rich and dynamic content.\nThere are cases when this can cause slow rendering phase updates, including\nscript to update views, style updates, layout, and paint. This, in turn, causes\njank or noticeable delay when presenting content, because rendering phase is\nupdated synchronously with user interactions and requestAnimationFrame script.\n\nThe following are a few of the common patterns that can cause jank:\n- Resizing multi-pane UI with complex layout within each pane (e.g. IDEs)\n- Adding widgets with complex DOM.\n- Dynamically displaying content based on the current value of text input.\n- Measuring layout of otherwise hidden DOM with intent of sizing containers.\n\nDevelopers are aware of these issues and build systems to avoid adding complex\nDOM at once in order to prevent jank. As an example, ReactJS is [adding the\nability](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html)\nto do async operations to help with this problem.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis document proposes to augment user-agent APIs to help address the problem of\nslow rendering phase updates. Specifically, we propose a concept of display\nlocking an element.\n\nIf an element is locked for display, it means that any DOM updates to its\nsubtree are not rendered immediately. Instead, when the lock is committed, the\nuser-agent processed rendering updates co-operatively, yielding periodically to\nallow script or user interactions to happen.\n\nThe visual content of an element's subtree which is locked for display does not\nchange. Specifically, if the element already existed in the DOM, then the\ncontent that was present at the time the lock was acquired remains. \n\nIf the element was locked before being inserted into the DOM, then it is\neffectively inserted in a hidden state, which means the user agent does not\ndisplay any content for this element or its subtree until the work is completed.\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nasync function updateDom() {\n  let element = document.createElement(\"div\");\n\n  // Construct the element\n  element.appendChild(...);\n  element.id = \"...\";\n\n  // Acquire a lock.\n  await element.displayLock.acquire();\n\n  // Append the element to the DOM.\n  document.body.appendChild(element);\n\n  // Now we can update the element, causing co-operative updates. After that\n  // resolves, we can commit the element making it visible to the user.\n  element.displayLock.update().then(() => {\n    element.displayLock.commit();\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nIn cases where DOM rendering would cause jank, this instead allows the\nuser-agent to split up the work across several frames, yielding for script and\nuser interactions. When the updates are finished processing, the result is\ncommitted and displayed without jank.\n\nNote that display locking allows several patterns, which serve as motivating\nexamples:\n\n- Splitting up the DOM construction work across several frames, while storing\n  intermediate results in the DOM itself under a locked element. These\n  intermediate results are not displayed until the lock is committed.\n- Postponing the rendering work indefinitely by controlling when the lock is\n  committed.\n- Performing co-operative rendering work using update(), which can always be\n  forced to be synchronous using a commit() call enabling an idle-until-urgent\n  pattern.\n- Measuring layout without jank or display by calling update() on a locked\n  element, then reading off relevant layout values and either removing the\n  element or committing it for display depending on the desired behavior.\n\n### Further reading\n\n- [Detailed explainer](https://github.com/WICG/display-locking/blob/master/explainer.md)\n- [Sample code](https://github.com/WICG/display-locking/blob/master/sample-code)\n  (work in progress)\n- [Layout transitions](http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/layout-transitions/) - a\n  similar proposal from 2014, with motivating examples that are applicable to\n  display locking.\n\n### Revision log\n\n- 2018-07-24: Initial version.\n- 2018-10-17: Updated the explainer to reflect new api surface. Closes #24.\n- 2018-12-21: Updated the explainer to acquire/update/commit API.\n- 2019-02-01: Updated to displayLock (previously getDisplayLock()), added updateAndCommit().\n"

At the same time any animations on the page must be rendered smoothly, also the work for fetching and preparing search results and updating the page must also progress quickly. \n\nThis is a lot of different deadlines to meet for the app developer. It is easy for any long running script work to hold up the main thread and cause responsiveness issues for typing, rendering animations or updating search results.\n\nThis problem can be tackled by systematically chunking and scheduling main thread work i.e. prioritizing and executing work async at an appropriate time relative to current situation of user and browser. \nA Main Thread Scheduler provides improved guarantees of responsiveness.\n\n## Case studies: Userspace schedulers\nSchedulers have been built in userspace in an attempt to chunk up main thread work and schedule it at appropriate times, in order to improve responsiveness and maintain high and smooth frame-rate.\nThe specific schedulers we looked at are: [Google Maps Scheduler](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling#case-study-1-maps-job-scheduler) and [React Scheduler](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling#case-study-2-react-scheduler). These [case studies](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling#appendix-scheduler-case-studies) demonstrate that schedulers can be (and have been) built as JS libraries, and also point to the platform gaps that they suffer from.\n\n## Scheduler anatomy: What it takes to build an effective scheduler\nWe analyzed various scheduling systems, including userspace schedulers above, and determined that the following are core aspects of an effective scheduling system for main thread:\n\n### 1. Set of tasks with priority\nTasks are work items posted by application to be run by scheduler (typically async). Tasks can be posted at specific priority, based on a pre-determined set of priorities.\n\n### 2. “virtual” task-queues for managing groups of tasks\nThis is to allow the app to:\n\n* dynamically update priority or cancel a group of tasks\n* synchronously run queued tasks (flush the queue) when the user navigates away etc\n\n### 3. API for posting tasks\nAPI to enable posting tasks -- at a pre-determined set of priority levels.\n\n### 4. run-loop\nA mechanism to execute tasks at an appropriate time, relative to the current state of the user and the browser.\n\n**What does the run-loop need for effective scheduling?**\n#### 4a. run-loop requires knowledge of:\n\n* 1. browser's rendering pipeline\n  * timing of next frame \n  * time budget within current frame\n* 2. state of input and user interaction\n  * is input pending \n  * how long do we have before input should be serviced\n  * loading, navigation\n\n#### b. run-loop requires effective coordination with other work on the main thread:\n\n* 1. fetches and network responses\n* 2. browser initiated callbacks: eg. onreadystatechange in xhr, post-message from worker etc\n* 3. browser’s internal work: eg. GC\n* 4. other developer scheduled callbacks: eg. settimeout\n* 5. propagation of priority across a series of related async calls\n* 6. rendering: tasks may be reprioritized depending on renderer state\n* 7. knowledge of read / write renderinng phases to avoid layout thrashing from interleaved reads & writes\n\n### Priorities for tasks\n\nFor work that the user has initiated by interacting with the app, the app developer would have to determine what action needs to be taken, and how to schedule work to target appropritate timing that is compatible with browser's rendering pipeline.\n\nInput handlers (tap, click etc) often need to schedule a combination of different kinds of work:\n* kicking off some immediate work as microtasks eg. fetching from local cache\n* scheduling data fetches over the network\n* rendering in the current frame eg. to respond to user typing, toggle the *like* button, start an animation when clicking on a comment list etc.\n* rendering over the course of next new frames, as fetches complete and data becomes available to prepare and render results.\n\n#### 1. \"Immediate\" priority\nUrgent work that must happen immediately.\nThis is essentially microtask timing: occurs right after current task and does not yield to the browser's event loop.\n\nNOTE: [queueMicrotask](https://fergald.github.io/docs/explainers/queueMicrotask.html) provides a direct API for submitting microtasks.\n\nNOTE: we've seen bad cases where developers accidentally do large, non-urgent work in microtasks -- with promise.then and await, without realizing it blocks rendering.\n\n#### 2. \"render-blocking\" priority (render-immediate?)\nUrgent rendering work that must happen in the limited time *within the current frame*.\nThis is typically work in requestAnimationFrame: i.e. rendering work for ongoing animations and dom manipulation that needs to render right away.\nTasks posted at this priority can delay rendering of the current frame, and therefore should finish quickly (otherwise use \"default\" priority).\n\n#### 2. \"default\" priority (or render-normal?)\nUser visible work that is needed to *prepare for the next frame* (or future frames).\nNormal work that is important, but can take a while to finish.\nThis is typically rendering that is needed in response to user interaction, but has dependency on network or I/O, and should be rendered over next couple frames - as the needed data becomes available.\nThis work should not delay current frame rendering, but should execute immediately afterwards to pipeline and target the next frame.\n\nNOTE: This is essentially setTimeout(0) without clamping; see other [workarounds used today](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling#3-after-paint-callback)\n\nEg. user zooms into a map, fetching of the maps tiles OR atleast post-processing of fetch responses should be posted as \"default\" priority work to render over subsequent frames.\nEg. user clicks a (long) comment list, it can take a while to fetch all the comments from the server; the fetches should be handled as \"default\" priority (and potentially start a spinner or animation, posted at \"render-blocking\" priority).\n\nNOTE: while it *may* make sense to kick off fetches in input-handler, handling fetch responses in microtasks can be problematic, and could block user input & urgent rendering work.\n\n#### 3. \"idle\"\nWork that is typically not visible to the user or initiated by the user, and is not time critical.\nEg. analytics, backups, syncs, indexing, etc.\n\nrequestIdleCallback (rIC) is the API for idle priority work.\n\n\n## API Shape\nWe intend to pursue a two-pronged approach:\n\n* I. Ship primitives to enable Javascript / userland schedulers to succeed: above components of scheduling can be built in javascript. However there are gaps that need to be filled for [4a](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling/blob/master/README.md#4a-run-loop-requires-knowledge-of) and [4b](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling/blob/master/README.md#4a-run-loop-requires-knowledge-of). These can be tackled as a set of APIs to plug these gaps. \n* II. Show proof-of-concept for a native platform scheduler, that is directly integrated into the browser's event-loop.\n\nMore details below, for each approach. \n\n### I. APIs to improve JS schedulers\n\nThe following (primitive) APIs are being pursued currently:\n#### 1. Is Input Pending\nKnowledge of whether input is pending, and the type of input.\nThis is covered here:\nhttps://github.com/tdresser/should-yield\n\n#### 2. Expected time to next animation frame\nJS schedulers are estimating the time to next animation frame with book-keeping, but it's not possible to estimate this properly without knowing browser internals.\n\nLink:\nhttps://github.com/szager-chromium/timeUntilNextFrame/blob/master/explainer.md\n\n#### 3. \"After-paint\" callback\nSchedulers need to execute \"default priority\" work immediately following the document lifecycle (style, layout, paint).\nCurrently they use workarounds to target this with:\n\n* postmessage after each rAF (used by ReactScheduler):\n* messagechannel workaround (google3 nexttick used by Maps etc): use a private message channel to postMessage empty messages; also tacked on after rAF. A bug currently prevents yielding.\n* settimeout 0: doesn’t work well, in Chrome this is clamped to 1ms and to 4ms after N recursions.\n\nLink:\nhttps://github.com/szager-chromium/requestPostAnimationFrame/blob/master/explainer.md\n\n#### Potential APIs we are thinking about\nWe are also thinking about the following problems. \nNote that these are not currently being pursued as API proposals, they are noted here for completeness and as a seed for discussion.\n\n##### Clean read (phase) after layout\nInterleaved reads and writes of dom result in layout thrashing.\nToday this is tackled with scheduling patterns like [fast-dom](https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom) and enforcement that goes along with this such as [strict-dom](https://github.com/wilsonpage/strictdom).\n\nIdeally, the read phase would occur immediately after style and layout have finished; and this would be followed by the write phase (default). A first class callback would allow developers to perform a clean read at the appropriate time.\n\n##### Propagating scheduling Context for async work\nA mechanism to inherit and propagate scheduling priority across related async calls: fetches, promises etc.\nSimilar in spririt to zone.js. \n\n\n### II. Built-in API\nThe run-loop could be built into the browser and integrated closely with the browser’s event-loop. This would automatically move [#4](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling/blob/master/README.md#4-run-loop) into the browser and [#3](https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling/blob/master/README.md#3-api-for-posting-tasks) becomes the platform exposed API. The API sketch follows.\n\nWe propose adding default task queues with three semantic priorities, i.e. enum TaskQueuePriority, can be one of these:\n\n* Immediate\n* Render-blocking\n* Default\n* Idle\n\n#### Global set of Serial Task queues\nTasks are guaranteed to start and finish in the order submitted, i.e. a task does not start until the previous task has completed.\n\nA set of global serial task queues will be made available to post work on main thread. There will be a global queue for each priority level.\n\n#### API for posting & canceling tasks\nNOTE: syntax is likely to change for compatibility for posting work off main thread variant (TODO: Link to repo).\n\n```\nfunction mytask() {\n  ...\n}\n\nmyQueue = TaskQueue.default(\"render-blocking\") \n```\nreturns the global task queue with priority “render-blocking”, for posting to main thread.\n```\ntaskId = myQueue.postTask(myTask, <list of args>);\n```\nwhere myTask is a callback.\nThe return value is a long integer, the task id, that uniquely identifies the entry in the queue. \n\n```\nmyQueue.cancelTask(taskId);\n```\ntaskId can be used to later cancel the task.\n\nNOTE: The return type could be a promise instead of ID, for convenience and chaining of tasks. If so, then [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) is a standard way to cancel pending promises.\n\n#### User-defined task queues\nDevelopers can define their own “virtual” serial task queues:\n```\nmyQueue = new TaskQueue(‘myCustomQueue’, \"default\");\nmyQueue.postTask(task, <list of args for task>);\n```\nwhere task is a function.\n\nUser-defined task queues enables the app to manage a group of tasks, such as updating priority, canceling, draining (synchronously executing tasks) when the page is hidden etc.\n\nUpdating priority of entire queue: ```myQueue.updatePriority(<new priority>);```\nUpdating priority of specific task is equivalent to canceling that task and re-posting at a different priority. \nFlushing the queue: ```myQueue.flush();```\n\nTODO: supporting additional priorities, beyond small set of semantic priorities. Add API ideas for this.\n\n### Open Questions & Challenges\n\n- DOM read-write phase: enabling tasks to target read vs write phases\n- API for frame rate throttling: 30 vs. 60fps\n- handling 3P and non-cooperating script (directly embedded) in the page \n- lowering priority of event handlers (similar to “passive”)\n\n## Appendix: Scheduler case studies\nNOTE: See [recent Slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HGBOAfVhmWoyOt2ETk-1Y2dOvuMyRnQ5AF7VrPBvfX0/edit).\n\n### Case study 1: Maps’ Job Scheduler\nThe scheduler attempts to render at the native framerate (usually ~60fps) but falling back to unit fractions of the native framerate (e.g. 1/2 native at ~30fps, 1/3 native at ~20fps, etc) if the native framerate cannot be achieved.\nIt works by classifying all work into several stages:\n1. Input: updating model state in response to user input.\n2. Animation: updating model state based on the current time.\n3. Rendering: drawing to the screen based on current model state.\n4. Other: everything else\nNote that 1, 2, and 3 must be done on every frame and is scheduled via rAF, everything else does not need to be done on every frame and is scheduled either through rIC OR in deferred manner to yield to the browser (postmessage after rAF, or settimeout 0). \nIn response to events, Jobs of one of these types are created and scheduled with the JobScheduler to be run.\n\nMaps needs throttling of frame-rate in the following cases:\n\n* on start-up, for prioritizing initialization over animation FPS \n* when switching into 3d Earth mode, and there's lots of data fetching and 3d model building to do, and it's not worth showing 60fps of gradual build-up of this.\n\n### Case-study 2: React Scheduler\nLink to [code is here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/43a137d9c13064b530d95ba51138ec1607de2c99/packages/react-scheduler/src/ReactScheduler.js)\n\nIt works by scheduling a rAF, noting the time for the start of the frame, then scheduling a postMessage which gets scheduled after paint. Within the postMessage handler do as much work as possible until time + frame rate.\nEeparating the \"idle call\" into a separate event tick ensures yielding to the browser work, and counting it against the available time.\n\nFrame rate is dynamically adapted. The scheduler [defaults to a target of 30fps](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/43a137d9c13064b530d95ba51138ec1607de2c99/packages/react-scheduler/src/ReactScheduler.js#L176) for standard units of work. It detects higher frame rate by timing successive scheduling of frames, and increasing to a higher target FPS if appropriate. \n\nInstead of task priority levels, it uses expiration times. This enables dynamic adjustment: something that starts as low priority gets higher as it approaches the deadline. Expired tasks are the most important.\n\nWhenever enqueuing via rAF, they also set a 100ms timeout, if the timeout is fired first it cancels the rAF and executes its associated tasks. This is a workaround for rAF not running in background & on occlusion. \n\n\n\n"

            "text": "# Explainer: Reducing `User-Agent` Granularity\n\nMike West, October 2018\n\n(_Note: This isn't a proposal that's well thought out, and stamped solidly with the Google Seal of\nApproval. It's a collection of interesting ideas for discussion, nothing more, nothing less._)\n\n## A Problem\n\nUser agents identify themselves to servers as part of each HTTP request via the `User-Agent` header.\nThis header's value has grown in both length and complexity over the years; a complicated dance\nbetween server-side sniffing to provide the right experience for the right devices on the one hand,\nand client-side spoofing in order to bypass incorrect or inconvenient sniffing on the other. Chrome\non iOS, for instance, currently identifies itself as:\n\n```http\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 12_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/69.0.3497.105 Mobile/15E148 Safari/605.1\n```\n\nWhile Chrome on Android sends something more like:\n\n```http\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; Pixel 2 XL Build/PPP3.180510.008) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Mobile Safari/537.36\n```\n\nThere's a lot of entropy wrapped up in the UA string. This makes it an important part of\nfingerprinting schemes of all sorts. Safari has [recently taken some steps][1] to reduce\nthe entropy of the user agent string, initially locking it to a single value, period, and\nthen [backing off a bit][2] due to developer feedback. This document proposes a mechanism\nwhich might allow user agents generally to be a little more aggressive.\n\n[1]: https://twitter.com/rmondello/status/943545865204989953?lang=en\n[2]: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182629#c6\n\n### Challenges \n\nFrom a developer's standpoint, the detail available in the UA string is valuable, and they\nreasonably object to dropping it. The feedback to Safari's UA string freeze was right along these\nlines, noting four broad categories of use:\n\n1.  Brand and version information (e.g. \"Chrome 69\") allows websites to work around known bugs in\n    specific releases that aren't otherwise detectable. For example, implementations of Content\n    Security Policy have varied wildly between vendors, and it's difficult to know what policy to\n    send in an HTTP response without knowing what browser is responsible for its parsing and\n    execution.\n\n2.  Developers will often negotiate what content to send based on the user agent and platform. Some\n    application frameworks, for instance, will style an application on iOS differently from the same\n    application on Android in order to match each platform's aesthetic and design patterns\n    (<https://onsen.io/> was the first example in a quick skim of search results, but there are\n    certainly others).\n\n3.  Similarly to #1, OS revisions and architecture can be responsible for specific bugs which can\n    be worked around in website's code, and narrowly useful for things like selecting appropriate\n    executables for download (32 vs 64 bit, ARM vs Intel, etc). Model information is likewise useful\n    when bugs are limited to particular kinds of devices.\n\n4.  Sophisticated developers use model/make to tailor their sites to the capabilities of the\n    device (e.g. [Facebook Year Class][3]) and to pinpoint performance bugs and regressions which\n    sometimes are specific to model/make.\n\nThese are use cases that are interesting for us to support. Browsers certainly have bugs, and\ndevelopers certainly would be well-served by being able to work around them. We'll keep these\nchallenges in mind with the proposal that follows.\n\n[3]: https://code.fb.com/android/year-class-a-classification-system-for-android/\n\n## A Proposal\n\nBy default, servers should receive only the user agent's brand and major version number. Servers\ncan opt-into receiving information about minor versions, the underlying operating system's major\nversion, and details about the underlying architecture and device. The user agent can make\nreasonable decisions about how to respond to sites' requests for more granular data. We might\naccomplish this as follows:\n\n1.  Browsers should deprecate the `User-Agent` string over time, initially locking bits of its\n    value, and ramping up over time to lock the entire string to something generic for the device\n    type. Chrome could perhaps send the following for mobile, regardless of the underlying device\n    type:\n\n    ```http\n    Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; Unspecified Device) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/71.1.2222.33 Mobile Safari/537.36\n    ```\n\n    And the following for desktop, similarly irrepspective of the underlying device:\n\n    ```http\n    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.1.2222.33 Safari/537.36\n    ```\n\n    These strings would stay static, adding cruft to every request from now until forever.\n\n    We can ratchet this deprecation over time, beginning by freezing the version numbers in the\n    header, then removing platform and model information as developers migrate to the alternative\n    mechanisms proposed below.\n\n2.  Similarly, user agents would freeze the `navigator.appVersion`, `navigator.platform`,\n    `navigator.productSub`, `navigator.vendor`, and `navigator.userAgent` attributes to\n    appropriate values for the frozen `User-Agent` string.\n\n3.  Browsers should introduce several new Client Hint header fields:\n\n    1.  The `Sec-UA` header field represents the user agent's brand and major version. For example:\n\n        ```http\n        Sec-CH-UA: \"Chrome 73\"\n        ```\n\n        Note: See the GREASE-like discussion below for how we could anticipate the inevitable lies\n        which user agents might want to tell in this field.\n\n    2.  The `Sec-CH-UA-Platform` header field represents the platform's brand and major version. For example:\n\n        ```http\n        Sec-CH-UA-Platform: \"Win 10\"\n        ```\n\n    3.  The `Sec-CH-UA-Arch` header field represents the underlying architecture's instruction set and\n        width. For example:\n\n        ```http\n        Sec-CH-UA-Arch: \"ARM64\"\n        ```\n\n    4.  The `Sec-CH-UA-Model` header field represents the user agent's underlying device model. For example:\n\n        ```http\n        Sec-CH-UA-Model: \"Pixel 2 XL\"\n        ```\n        \n4.  These client hints should also be exposed via JavaScript APIs, perhaps hanging off a new\n    `navigator.getUserAgent()` method as something like:\n\n\n    ```idl\n    interface mixin NavigatorUA {\n      [SecureContext] Promise<NavigatorUAData> getUserAgent();\n    };\n    Navigator includes NavigatorUA;\n\n    interface NavigatorUAData {\n      readonly attribute DOMString brand;          // \"Chrome\"\n      readonly attribute DOMString version;        // \"69\"\n      readonly attribute DOMString platform;       // \"Win 10\"\n      readonly attribute DOMString architecture;   // \"ARM64\"\n      readonly attribute DOMString model;          // \"\"\n    };\n    ```\n\n    User agents can make intelligent decisions about what to reveal in each of these attributes.\n    Top-level sites a user visits frequently (or installs!) might get more granular data than\n    cross-origin, nested sites, for example. We could conceivably even inject a permission prompt\n    between the site's request and the Promise's resolution, if we decided that was a reasonable\n    approach.\n\nUser agents will attach the `Sec-CH-UA` header to every secure outgoing request by default, with a value\nthat includes only the major version (e.g. \"`Chrome 69`\"). Servers can opt-into receiving more\ndetailed version information in the `Sec-CH-UA` header, along with the other available Client Hints, by\ndelivering an `Accept-CH` header header in the usual way.\n\nNote the word \"secure\" in the paragraph above, and the `SecureContext` attribute in the IDL: these\nclient hints will not be delivered to plaintext endpoints. Non-secure HTTP will receive only the\nlocked `User-Agent` string, now and forever.\n\n### For example...\n\nA user agent's initial request to `https://example.com` will include the following request headers:\n\n```http\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\n            Chrome/71.1.2222.33 Safari/537.36\nSec-CH-UA: \"Chrome 74\"\n```\n\nIf a server delivers the following response header:\n\n```http\nAccept-CH: UA, UA-Platform, UA-Arch\n```\n\nThen subsequent requests to `https://example.com` will include the following request headers:\n\n```http\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\n            Chrome/71.1.2222.33 Safari/537.36\nSec-CH-UA: \"Chrome 74.0.3424.124\"\nSec-CH-UA-Platform: \"macOS 12\"\nSec-CH-UA-Arch: \"ARM64\"\n```\n\nThe user agent can make reasonable decisions about when to honor requests for detailed user agent\nhints and first-parties can use `Feature-Policy` to decide which third-parties they'd like to\nprivilege with detailed user agent information. In any event, moving to this opt-in model means\nthat the extent of a site's usage can be monitored and evaluated.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Do we really need to neuter the JavaScript interface too?\n\nAn excellent question! This proposal assumes that developers with access to JavaScript execution\ndo not need the user agent string in order to determine which resources to load and how they\nought to behave. They can examine other parts of the exposed API surface\n(`WEBGL_debug_renderer_info`, for example). Developers who need this kind of information at\nrequest-time could probably migrate to alternative mechanisms like Client Hints.\n\nOur goal should eventually be to ratchet down on some of this granularity as well, and my intuition\nis that we'll be able to do that more cleanly if we adjust the UA string in one fell swoop, and\nthen move on to the rest rather than doubling back at some point in the future.\n\n## What about the compatibility hit we'll take from UA sniffing?\n\nLocking the User-Agent string will lock in the existing behavior of UA-sniffing libraries. That\nmay break things in the future if we diverge significantly from today's behavior in some \ninteresting way, but that doesn't seem like a risk unique to this proposal.\n\n## Should the UA string be a set?\n\nHistory has shown us that there are real incentives for user agents to lie about their branding\nin order to thread the needle of sites' sniffing scripts. While I'm optimistic that we can reset\nexpectations around sniffing by freezing the thing that's sniffed-upon today, and creating a sane \nset of options for developers, it's likely that this is hopelessly naive. It's reasonable to\nponder what we should do to encourage sniffing in the right way, if we believe it's going to\nhappen one way or another.\n\nOne suggestion is to model `UA` as a set, rather than a single entry. For example, user agents\nmight encourage standardized processing of the `UA` string by randomly including additional,\nintentionally incorrect, comma-separated entries with arbitrary ordering (similar conceptually\nto TLS's [GREASE][4]). Chrome 73's `UA` value might then be `\"Chrome 73\", \"NotBrowser 12\"`, or\n`\"BrowsingIsFun Version 12b\", \"Chrome 73\"`.\n\nWe'd reflect this value in the `NavigatorUAData.brand` attribute.\n\n[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-grease-01\n\n## As a concrete example, what UA string would Chrome on iOS send?\n\nChrome on iOS (as well as Edge on Android and iOS, Firefox on iOS, and every other non-Safari\nbrowser on iOS) are interesting cases in which the underlying browser engine on a given platform\ndoesn't match the engine that the relevant browser built themselves. What should we do in these\ncases?\n\nI think we have a few options for the string:\n\n1.  `\"Chrome 73\"`, which has the least entropy, but also sets poor expectations.\n2.  `\"CriOS 73\"` (or `\"Chrome on iOS 73\"`, or similar) which is basically what's sent today, and categorizes the browser as distinct.\n3.  `\"CriOS 73\", \"Safari 12\"`, which is interesting.\n4.  `\"Chrome 73\", \"Safari 12\"`, which is more interesting.\n\nI think I prefer the second.\n\n(A more verbose alternative could add a `Sec-CH-UA-Engine` header, containing values like `Blink`,\n`EdgeHTML`, `Gecko`, or `WebKit`.)\n\n## Wait a minute, I don't see this delegation stuff in the Client Hints spec...\n\nRight. There are more than a few open PRs:\n\n* Fetch integration of Accept-CH opt-in: [whatwg/fetch#773](whatwg/fetch#773)\n* HTML integration of Accept-CH-Lifetime and the ACHL cache: [whatwg/HTML#3774](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3774)\n* Adding new CH features to the CH list in Fetch: [whatwg/fetch#725](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/725)\n* Other PRs for adding the Feature Policy 3rd party opt-in: [whatwg/fetch#811](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/811) and [wicg/feature-folicy#220](https://github.com/wicg/feature-policy/issues/220)\n\n## What's with the `Sec-CH-` prefix?\n\nBased on some discussion in [w3ctag/design-reviews#320](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/320#issuecomment-435874298),\nit seems reasonable to forbid access to these headers from JavaScript, and demarcate them as\nbrowser-controlled client hints so they can be documented and included in requests without triggering\nCORS preflights. A `Sec-CH-` prefix seems like a viable approach. _This bit might shift as the broader\nClient Hints discussions above coalesce into something more solid that lands in specs_.\n"

It's a collection of interesting ideas for discussion, nothing more, nothing less._)\n\n## A Problem\n\nUser agents specify a set of languages as part of each HTTP request via the `Accept-Languages` header.\nThis header's value is critical for some kinds of content negotiation, ideally allowing servers to give\neach user content in a language they prefer. My user agent sends a header along the lines of:\n\n```http\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,de;q=0.8\n```\n\nThis shows that I prefer content in English, but accept content in German as well. That's great for\na few important use cases, but exposes quite a bit of entropy to the web at large, even though a\nsmall subset of sites I visit will actually use the information to improve my experience.\n\nThis document proposes that we deprecate that header, and move to an opt-in model which will reveal\nmy language preferences to the specific sites that declare they can do something useful with it,\nwhile keeping them off the wire for the rest.\n\n## A Proposal\n\nIn the glorious future, servers will receive no information about the user's language preferences.\nServers can instead opt-into receiving such information via a new `Lang` [Client Hint][1]. We might\naccomplish this as follows:\n\n[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints\n[2]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure\n\n1.  Browsers should deprecate and eventually remove the `Accept-Language` header. In order to\n    quickly realize some privacy gains without a lot of compatibility impact, the header could be\n    locked to something genericly appropriate (perhaps based on typical language preferences for the\n    user's rough, IP-based geolocation) as an intermediate step.\n\n2.  Browsers should introduce a new `Sec-CH-Lang` header field, representing the users'\n    language preferences. This would be a [Structured Header][2] whose value is a flat list of\n    language codes in the users' preferred order. For example:\n\n    ```http\n    Sec-CH-Lang: \"en-US\", \"en\", \"de\"\n    ```\n\n3.  Browsers should restrict the `navigator.language` and `navigator.languages` APIs to secure\n    contexts, to match Client Hints' scope.\n\n4.  Servers can opt-into the new `Lang` Client Hint by delivering an appropriate `Accept-CH`\n    header in the usual way:\n\n    ```http\n    Accept-CH: Lang, DPR, Width\n    ```\n\n    Note that `Accept-CH` is only accepted over secure transport: this proposal has the effect\n    of deprecating language availability over plaintext entirely. Note also that only the top-level\n    document's server can opt-into Client Hints. If third-parties require the data, it can be\n    delegated to them via an appropriate Feature Policy.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## What about the first request? How will the server know what to do?\n\nIf the server absolutely requires language information to make a reasonable decision about what\ndata to send to the user, it can do so by sending an `Accept-CH` header along with a 302 response,\ncausing another navigation request, which will include the `Sec-CH-Lang` header.\n\n## Should we include the `q` weighting?\n\nThe `Accept-Language` header includes a weighting mechanism (e.g. the `q=0.8` bits in the example\nabove). A potential application of that is expressing equal preference for two or more languages,\nbut the challenge of exposing such an option to users (compared to an ordered list) seems to make\npractical use unlikely. I'll blithely assert that `q` weighting can be removed without impact.\n\n## Wait a minute, I don't see this delegation stuff in the Client Hints spec...\n\nRight. There are more than a few open PRs:\n\n* Fetch integration of Accept-CH opt-in: [whatwg/fetch#773](whatwg/fetch#773)\n* HTML integration of Accept-CH-Lifetime and the ACHL cache: [whatwg/HTML#3774](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3774)\n* Adding new CH features to the CH list in Fetch: [whatwg/fetch#725](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/725)\n* Other PRs for adding the Feature Policy 3rd party opt-in: [whatwg/fetch#811](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/811) and [wicg/feature-folicy#220](https://github.com/wicg/feature-policy/issues/220)\n\n## What's with the `Sec-CH-` prefix?\n\n Based on some discussion in [w3ctag/design-reviews#320](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/320#issuecomment-435874298),\nit seems reasonable to forbid access to these headers from JavaScript, and demarcate them as\nbrowser-controlled client hints so they can be documented and included in requests without triggering\nCORS preflights. A `Sec-CH-` prefix seems like a viable approach. _This bit might shift as the broader\nClient Hints discussions above coalesce into something more solid that lands in specs_.\n"

            "text": "# MNX\n\nWelcome to the [Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/)'s next-generation music markup proposal.\n\nQuick links:\n\n- Read the [current MNX draft specification](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/).\n- Peruse the [MNX-Common examples](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/tree/master/examples).\n- Look at the [MNX-Generic examples](https://joeberkovitz.github.io/gmnx-viewer/).\n\n## An introduction to MNX-Common\n\nMNX-Common is a new, open standard for representing music notation as machine-readable data. It’s still being created, but this document gives context on our goals and plans.\n\nConceptually, MNX-Common is a way to represent this image:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/w3c/mnx/blob/master/middle-c.png\" alt=\"Image of music notation with middle C\" width=\"300\">\n\n...as something like this:\n\n```\nstaves=1\nkeysignature=C major\nclef=treble\nnotes=whole note at C4\n```\n\nThe former, an image, is intended for humans. A computer can’t understand it without using advanced, error-prone [computer vision techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition).\n\nThe latter — which encodes the _meaning_ (aka _semantics_) of the music, as opposed to a specific collection of pixels — is much easier for a computer to understand. Treating music in this way means it can be shared among different programs, automatically manipulated and much more.\n\nMNX-Common is a standard that describes how to encode music, so that computers can have a shared understanding on how to interpret it. As HTML describes a web page such that any web browser can read it, MNX-Common describes a piece of music such that any notation software can read or write it.\n\n### Motivation\n\nPeople have been using computers to encode music for decades; a wide variety of encoding formats has been developed over the years. Why do we need yet another format?\n\nEach music encoding format has its own biases and priorities. The [ABC format](https://abcnotation.com/), for example, aims for simplicity and was originally developed for folk music. [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/) is optimized for notation interchange. [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) focuses on low-level instrument sequencing, as opposed to higher-level musical concepts. [MEI](https://music-encoding.org/), a general-purpose framework for encoding arbitrary musical documents, pays particular attention to the needs of scholars. Proprietary formats, such as [Finale](https://www.finalemusic.com/)’s `.musx` or [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius)’ `.sib`, are optimized for specific notation programs and not meant to be read by others.\n\nOur goal with MNX-Common is to create a format that does all of the following:\n\n* **It’s open**, meaning: it’s clearly documented, free to use and developed in a vendor-independent, inclusive way.\n* **It supports all of Common Western Musical Notation (CWMN)**, meaning: it has a clear answer for how to encode any musical concept found in CWMN. (CWMN is, by nature, an [imprecise concept](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/overview/#mnx-score-types).)\n* **It prioritizes interchange**, meaning: it can be generated unambiguously, it can be parsed unambiguously, it favors one-and-only-one way to express concepts, and multiple programs reading the same MNX-Common file will interpret it the same way.\n* **It’s semantically rich**, meaning: it’s biased toward encoding concepts rather than presentation when prudent.\n* **It can be used as a native format**, meaning: it’s robust enough for programs to use directly instead of needing to invent their own format.\n\nThe existing format that comes closest to these goals is MusicXML. In fact, MNX-Common’s creation is being led by the [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/), which also oversees the MusicXML standard. So what’s the difference?\n\nWe see MNX-Common as the next generation of MusicXML, enabling new uses that MusicXML didn’t set out to support.\n\nWith hundreds of applications supporting it, MusicXML has succeeded in becoming the de facto notation interchange standard. These days, you can be reasonably sure that, if you compose music in a commonly used notation application, you’ll be able to export it and open it in another application with decent fidelity — thanks to MusicXML. This has been a major cultural step forward, considering major notation programs hadn’t always looked kindly on making music exportable into competitors’ products.\n\nAs the dream of universal interchange has become a reality, users and developers have come to demand even more. Users want richer interchange (i.e., preserving the details of music more crisply), the advent of “reflowing” web-based renderers has shifted expectations around music engraving, and some developers even use MusicXML as a native format (something it wasn’t designed to do).\n\nMNX-Common is an effort to take everything we’ve learned from 15 years of MusicXML development — along with its diverse community of developers, musicians and publishers — and build a better future together.\n\nFinally, we should note there are many music notation systems throughout the world’s cultures, along with historical notation systems. MNX-Common deals specifically with Common Western Musical Notation, as it’s a high priority for the current MusicXML community and it’s where our collective expertise is the strongest — but our long-term plan is to support other systems. We’re also designing a format tentatively called MNX-Generic, which allows for mappings between graphics and audio, and we envision adding other formats to the MNX family.\n\n### The plan / current status\n\nThe first step in our design was assembling an exhaustive list of roles and use cases for music notation in general. We published this document, [MNX Use Cases](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/use-cases/), in 2017. Not every use case there is meant to be covered by MNX-Common, but this is a solid reference that helps us consider the spectrum of what people do with digital music notation. It also gives us a common language around “roles” such as Composer, Performer or Developer.\n\nBeyond that, we’ve jumped into writing [an early draft specification for MNX-Common](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/overview/). The [MNX GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/issues) collects open issues we need to work through in designing the format.\n\nOur plan of action is to start with large questions — such as whether notes are stored by their sounding pitch or written pitch — and progressively nail down the format.\n"

After the end of a working group, the test suites often become frozen, and it is difficult to add new tests for issues that come to light later on. Similarly, some specs are implemented on a base technology, which eventually evolves (e.g. SPARQL 1.1 and RDF 1.1), and developers need access to updated tests.\r\n\r\nThis group will create a home for forks of the various test suites that would be appropriate to act as a redirect for existing tests. Test updates will be considered based on the consensus of those invested in the related specifications. Implementation reports can be updated as new reports are received, giving implementations visibility.\r\n\r\nThis group will not publish Specifications.",

See [Issue #661](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/661) for the progress of upstreaming those parts from the partially out-of-date [Shadow DOM](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) document.\n    - [Issues against the DOM and HTML Standard](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22topic%3A+shadow%22+is%3Aopen).\n    - [Issues raised in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/shadow-dom).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14978) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n- Custom Elements\n    - Custom elements were upstreamed into the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements) (and bits in the DOM Standard) and are maintained there.\n    - [Issues against the DOM and HTML Standard](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22topic%3A+custom%20elements%22+is%3Aopen).\n    - [Issues raised in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/custom-elements).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14968) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n- HTML Templates\n    - HTML Templates were upstreamed into the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element) and are fully maintained there.\n- CSS changes\n    - The CSS WG works on [CSS Scoping](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/) and [CSS Shadow Parts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shadow-parts/), which help dealing with shadow trees with various selectors. Various other parts of CSS and its object model are also impacted by shadow trees and directly worked on in the various CSS specificaions.\n    - [Issues against the CSS WG repository](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/topic%3A%20shadow).\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease file issues in the most specific repository possible, per the above issue pointers. (It's often not this repository.)\n\n## Abandoned features:\n\n- [HTML Imports](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)\n    - [The current issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/html-imports).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=20683) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n    - Note: Although it is still a rough idea, *HTML Modules*, rebuilding HTML Imports functionality using the ES Modules, are now being planned.\n      See [HTML Imports and ES Modules](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/HTML-Imports-and-ES-Modules.md) for details.\n"

These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).\n"

            "text": "**The Input Events spec**\n\n[Level 1](https://rawgit.com/w3c/input-events/v1/index.html)\n\n[Level 2](http://w3c.github.io/input-events/)\n\nLevel 1 has two implementations (Chrome and Safari) and level 2 has one (Safari). Level 2 corresponds to the consensus reached within the Editing Taskforce at the end of 2016. Level 1 is a subset that was split off in early 2017, when the Chromium team announced that it would not implement the entire specifition. At this time Safari had already implemented the full specification. We also did not want to give up level 2 of the spec, because it actually resolves a lot of issues and there has been no counter-proposal to effectively solve these issues from the Android team or others. Given that Chromium team told the Editing Taskforce that it either had to release a spec with their proposed changes or they would drop the spec entirely, it was decided to split the specification in two levels.\n\nEven though the specs look somewhat similar, they have to be handled quite differently by JavaScript editors:\n\n* Level 1 gives the JS editor information about proposed changes from the user, but it makes the related DOM change be non-cancelable in many cases. The event is therefore only useful in combination with a way to roll back the DOM after the DOM change has been made, most likely a DOM-diffing library. In the case of IME, it is extra difficult to handle as DOM changes cannot be reverted before the composition has finished.\n\n* Level 2 gives the JS editor information information about the proposed changes from the user and let's the JS author cancel the changes the browser otherwise would have done. There is one exception to this and that is IME, which cannot be canceled due to various technical constraints, but events have been added before and after IME input that effectively allow the JS author to isolate IME input. A JS editor based on level 2 should therefore be implementable without including DOM-diffing libraries or rolling browser-made DOM-changes back. A test of trying to create an editor using the event was conducted by the CKEditor team in the second half of 2016 before it was implemented in browsers.\n"

All email comments will be available in a\n[public archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps).\n\nIf you are not a participant in the [W3C Web Platform Working Group](https://w3.org/WebPlatformWG) \nyour contributions may be marked as having \"IPR issues\". If the contributions are purely editorial,\nthis will be handled by the editors, but if they involve changes to conformance, such as new features,\nthey will not be accepted without a formal agreement to W3C's intellectual property policies (see below for more) \n\n### Issues\nIssues should describe the problem. Proposals to fix it can be made as comments on the issue,\nbut should include known implementation of the proposal.\n\nIf you want to make a Pull request for simple editorial corrections, it is not necessary to raise an issue.\n\n### Pull requests\nThe best way to propose a fix is to make a branch,\ncommit your changes to the branch and then create a Pull Request. Pull Requests should inclue the following information:\n\n; Does it fix a known issue? \n: If so, add `Fix #333, #222` in a line by itself in a comment, which will close the issue\n; Does it relate to a known issue? \n: If so, add a comment like `see also #444, #111`, and preferably an explanation of how it relates.\n: If not, and it is more than merely editorial, please open an issue\n; Known implementation of the change\n; Links to tests for any changed behaviour\n: Ideally these will be in the form of Web-platform-tests but there are things that can require a manual test.\n; Acknowledgements and changelog updates\n: If the issue has been worked on by somebody who is not acknowledged already in the acknolwedgements section,\n please add their name\n: If the change is substantive, i.e. affects conformance, or a significant editorial one, please note it in the changes section\n\n## Licensing and IPR\n\nContributions to this repository are expected to become part of a Recommendation governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[W3C Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

This is developed by the [ARIA Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/). The staff contact is [Michael Cooper](http://www.w3.org/People/cooper/). Please do not provide commit access to this repository without coordination.\n\n## Other Repositories\n\nThis repository is for the main deliverable of the ARIA Working Group, Accessible Rich Internet Applications. There are several other deliverables, such as ARIA modules, Accessibility API Mappings, and support documents. These are maintained in separate repositories listed on the [ARIA Contribution](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/contribute) page. Please file issues in the repository specific to the specification to which the issue applies.\n\n## Contributing to this Repository\n\n### Role of Editors\n\nOnly formally designated editors have commit access to this repository. Editors are designated by the Working Group Chair and make the following commitments:\n\n* Execute the consensus of the Working Group regardless of personal opinion;\n* Seek Working Group review of substantive technical issues;\n* In good faith separate editorial issues, which may be addressed without explicit review requests, from substantive issues which require review;\n* Follow the [W3C Manual of Style](http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/) and the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/);\n* Follow [W3C Editors](http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/) guidelines.\n\n### Non-Editor Contributions\n\nWorking Group participants and members of the public without commit privileges may contribute to this repository in the following ways:\n\n* Raise [issues](issues).\n* Submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nIssues can be assigned to people who are members of the [ARIA Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/aria-contributors) team. Editors can add people to this team.\n\nWhen preparing GitHub pull requests:\n\n* Provide a complete summary and description for each pull request. The Working Group needs to understand the rationale for proposed changes. This description may need to be very detailed in some cases, or may be quite brief, for example if providing a change to address a spelling issue.\n* Keep pull requests specific to individual comments. Some comments may require changes to multiple source files, for example if an external link is incorrect in multiple files, and this is appropriate if the changes all relate to the same comment. However, if several separate comments are submitted together within a single pull request,  it is more difficult for the working group to parse the different points made in the comment and unless the group agrees with all aspects of the comment the pull request may need to be rejected.\n* Whenever possible, please create a separate pull request for each specification you are modifying. Doing so allows each specification editor to incorporate your contributions without having to check with the editors of the other documents you are modifying or to perform multiple manual merges.\n* Following the editorial documentation below will help prepare a pull request that is ready for inclusion with minimal editing.\n\nWhen a pull request is accepted by the Working Group, an editor will integrate changes. Pull requests and issues that are accepted by the working group will be merged into the source documents and the commenter will receive a notification from GitHub that the pull request was accepted.\n\n## Editorial Documentation\n\nDocuments in this repository use the [Respec](http://www.w3.org/respec/) preprocessor.\n\n### Special Elements and Classes\n\n#### Role, State, and Property References\n\nThe ARIA spec allows easy generation of links to roles, states, and properties, with the right link and styling. Simply enclose the name of the role, state, or property in the following elements:\n\n* `<rref>` for roles\n* `<sref>` for states\n* `<pref>` for properties\n\nNote: this only works in the ARIA spec. Other specs must use cross references as defined below.\n\n#### References to Other ARIA Specs\n\nLinks with special class attributes allow cross references into other specs in the suite, which are transformed by the script to be the appropriate target for the given publication, so editors' drafts point to other editors' drafts, and TR publications point to other TR publications. This requires some configuration options in the respecConfig and use of special class attributes.\n\nFirst, for each document that might be referenced, a set of URLs is provided. The URLs are indexed by values of the [respec spec status](http://www.w3.org/respec/ref.html#specstatus), which ensures the target at the same level of maturity as the current version is used. A typical set of values for the main ARIA spec is:\n\n```js\n// Spec URLs\nariaSpecURLs: {\n  \"FPWD\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"ED\": \"http://w3c.github.io/aria/aria/aria.html\",\n  \"WD\" : \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"REC\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/\"\n},\n```\n\nNote that even though some of these URIs are redundant, they must all be defined to work in all circumstances. If a document is a First Public Working Draft but the FPWD variant isn't defined, there won't be a match with the `specStatus` and the links won't work.\n\nThe following properties for cross references are currently available *(todo: we should add versions for the other docs)*:\n\n* `ariaSpecURLs`: for the main ARIA spec\n* `coreMappingURLs`: for the Core AAM\n* `accNameURLs`: for the AccName AAM\n* `htmlMappingURLs`: for the HTML AAM\n\nThe task of fixing up links is done by a script that needs to be hooked in via the following line in the respecConfig:\n\n```js\npreProcess: [ linkCrossReferences ]\n```\n\nOnce all this is defined in the `respecConfig`, use the `class` attribute on the links to activate the script for that link. The value of the `href` should be the fragment you want to target, i.e,. the hash tag and fragment ID. For example, a link to the list of roles in the ARIA spec would be:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#role_definitions\" class=\"specref\">ARIA roles</a>\n```\n\nIf you want to target the main spec, leave the href blank (but present). If you want other classes on the link, e.g., for styling, provide them after the script-hooking class, for instance `class=\"specref role-reference\"`.\n\nThe set of class values currently defined are:\n\n* `role-reference`: role definitions\n* `state-reference`: state definitions\n* `property-reference`: property definitions\n* `specref`: other targets in the main ARIA spec\n* `core-mapping`: the Core AAM\n* `html-mapping`: the HTML AAM\n* `accname`: the AccName AAM\n\n*Todo: we should add versions for the other docs*\n\n### Shared Resources\n\nThe ARIA repositories share a common set of resources to reduce redundancy. Shared resources are in the [aria-common](https://github.com/w3c/aria-common/) repository, and copied to a \"common\" folder in this and other ARIA repositories. *It is important to make edits in the aria-common repository*; making edits in the common folder of another repository will allow the edits to be overridden.\n\n### Special Structures\n\nTodo: special characteristics table classes etc. used by the script\n\n### Editors' Drafts\n\nOfficial editors' drafts are published to  [https://w3c.github.io/aria/]. This URI is suitable for public references. Documents published to that location are *static* snapshots from the Respec processor. This is to minimize load time for consumers of these drafts. Editors' drafts are automatically updated (if there are no errors) by a [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) service run when commits are pushed to the master branch.\n\n### How ARIA Extension Specs are Built\n\nAn extension spec is one that defines additional roles, states, and / or properties that augment\nthe collection defined in the core ARIA specification (aria/aria.html).  Extension specs must be\nbuilt in conjunction with the W3C ARIA WG if any new roles are to be in the default vocabulary space\n(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab).\n\nWhen building an extension spec, use the boiler plate provided in aria/template.html as a basis.  \n\nNote that this template uses the aria/script/ariaChild.js script.  That script knows how to incorporate\ninformation from the core ARIA specification into the extension spec so that new roles, states, and properties\nare well integrated into the overall ARIA taxonomy.\n\nThe ariaChild.js script relies upon an input script (aria/script/roleInfo.js).  As of today, that file is not automatically generated.\nIf you want to ensure the file is up to date, access the core ARIA spec with the special query string \"#saveRoles\"\nfrom a browser on a client that has write access to the copy of the extension spec you are editing. When the dialog appears, click\nthe save button and tell your browser to save the roleInfo.js file into the aria/script directory.\n\nThe scripts to support extension modules are stored in the aria-common repository. Therefore, updates to roleInfo.js must be saved and committed to that repository, even though they are generated from content in this repository.\n\n### Style guidelines\n\n#### Document style\n\n* There should always be introductory content before starting subsections.\n* Sequences of steps use ordered lists, the first paragraph of which labels the step and is in a &lt;strong&gt;; subsequent block elements are the content for the step.\n* Preformatted examples should \"pretty-print\" the example to be less than 80 characters wide, and indent the code using 2 space characters per indent step. Wrap within an element tag with an extra indent. Use line break characters, not &lt;br/&gt; elements, for new lines. Add extra line spacing as useful. They use the class \"example\". Use the Code Sample Expander tool to assist with this.\n* Keyboard characters should be in kbd elements.\n    * Spell out keys such as \"control\", \"shift\", \"command\", \"option\", \"alt\", \"insert\", \"pageup\", \"enter\", etc.\n    * Use plus as delimiter for keys that are pressed together, e.g., control+v\n    * Use comma as delimiter for keys that are pressed in sequence, e.g., insert, m\n* Language elements should be in code elements.\n* The first reference in a section to a role or state should be linked to the role or state with the appropriate class. Subsequent references needn't be referenced, but may be in certain circumstances.\n* repeated links to aria features should just be in &lt;code&gt;, not in cross-reference links (just link first time)\n* Headings use title case.\n* \"step\" headings, the bold sentence at the start of a numbered list item in a list of steps, are sentence case and not marked as an actual hx element. They should summarize what the following paragraphs get into.\n* Subheadings: only use sub-headers (&lt;h{x+1}&gt; following &lt;hx&gt;) if there are at least two of them. If there isn't more than two sub-sections, it isn't a sub-section and should be integrated into the parent section.\n* Lists: only use lists of two or more items. If it's only one item, it isn't a list and should have a different semantic.\n* Terms like \"Web\" are capitalized when it's \"the Web\", but not when referring to \"web applications\". Same for \"internet, rich internet applications\".\n* Synopsize the meaning of abbreviations and glossary terms the first time they are used in a section.\n* Acronyms we don't expand (but wrap in &lt;abbr&gt; elements):\n    * API\n* Acronyms we do expand (don't use the acronym)\n    * RIA (use rich internet application)\n    * AT (use assistive technology)\n* Cross reference links don't include section numbers.\n* Refer to states and properties in prose as \"attributes\", not as \"states\" or \"properties\" in order to be less confusing. (though they're still formally states or properties)\n\n#### Preferred terminology\n\n* When referring to an instance of a role, use \"element with a role of X\", not \"X role\" or \"X element\". \"X role\" refers to role in the taxonomy itself; \"X element\" is not technically meaningful.\n* \"Ajax\" is not spelled \"AJAX\"\n* \"Assistive technologies\" is plural, not singular.\n* Use \"WAI-ARIA\" instead of \"ARIA\", to avoid trademark confusion.\n* Use \"text alternative\" instead of \"text equivalent\" or the like, for consistency with WCAG 2.0 usage.\n* Reference \"DOMClick\" instead of \"DOMActivate\" which is going to be deprecated or made optional.\n\n#### Specification rules\n\n* Descendants of the composite role MUST NOT have the \"nameFrom\" value of \"contents\" set.\n* The composite role and its descendants MUST NOT have a childrenArePresentational value of \"true\".\n\n### Quality Assurance Checklist\n\nIn general, but particularly when preparing documents for TR publication, editors should check the following quality points:\n\n* Editor / author credits\n* [Participant credits](common/acknowledgements.html)\n* Documents are [valid HTML 5](http://validator.w3.org/)\n* Documents use the [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/) syntax to allow XML-based tools to process them and help catch errors caused by markup ambiguities.\n* Documents do not have [broken links or unnecessary redirects](http://validator.w3.org/checklink)\n* Spelling / typos\n* Consistent use of approved spellings when multiple are possible\n\n### Semi-Automated Sanity Checking\n\nThere was some automated sanity checking available, previously run by XSLT. This feature may be restored. The sanity check report helped determine the following potential issues:\n\n* When inheritance of roles change, the states they support may change. The tools will indicate when there is a change of supported states by comparison to an earlier version of the spec. It is a manual decision whether the changes are desired or if the set of supported states needs to be updated.\n* Ensure that supported state not defined if the state is also inherited\n* Check that the role spec and the UML Class Diagram express the same thing\n* Roles list only supported states that are defined\n* States indicate applicability only to roles that are defined\n* Roles and states cross reference each other: roles indicate supported states, and those states indicate applicability to those roles; discrepancies called out for manual attention\n"

Each milestone corresponds to a working draft or release published to w3.org.\n* Work is organized by topic in our [projects](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/projects). Each project corresponds to a type of design pattern or section of guidance.\n* The [scope of work and roadmap](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Scope) are described in the project wiki.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Comment in an existing issue or raise a new issue, expressing your willingness to help and briefly summarizing the nature of your proposed resolution.\n2. An editor will confirm there are no conflicting plans and, if needed, provide guidance.\n3. Be sure you have ESLint configured as described below.\n4. Read our wiki page about [submitting pull requests](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Submitting-Pull-Requests).\n5. Do some fabulous work and submit a pull request.\n\nNote: Please feel free to ask questions either through an issue or on the [Authoring Practices Task Force mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria-practices/).\n\n### Code conformance\n\nThis repository utilizes [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) tools to do static code analysis and ensure consistent code quality across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each linting tool and respective code standards are documented below and in the [code guide](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide).\n\nPull requests that contain linting errors will not be merged until the errors are resolved. To make this easier, you can install and run the tools locally before pushing code. Also note that the tools for CSS and JavaScript will automatically fix many issues if you have them installed locally. To install these tools:\n\n1. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which comes with [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)\n1. Open the directory that contains your `aria-practices` repository in a terminal\n1. Run `npm install`\n\nIt is also highly recommended that you use a code editor that supports these tools and [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).\n\n#### HTML\n\nHTML is validated against the [NU HTML Validator](https://github.com/validator/validator).\nShould a warning or error occur because a future ARIA feature is not yet implemented, it will be added to the [the .vnurc file](.vnurc), allowing the error to pass through.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:html\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nCSS is validated by [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) using the [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) ruleset.\n\n**NOTE**: on commit, stylelint will be run on staged CSS files. If errors are found that can be [automatically fixed with the --fix flag](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/cli/#autofixing-errors), they will be fixed and the changes committed.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:css\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is validated by [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), using [our own config](.eslintrc.json).\n\n**NOTE**: on commit, eslint will be run on staged CSS files. If errors are found that can be [automatically fixed with the --fix flag](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems), they will be fixed and the changes committed.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:js\n```\n\n### Test and fix your code\n\n1. Open a terminal window to the directory that contains the `aria-practices` repository\n1. The repository has a script defined that will test all JavaScript in the examples directory. To run it, execute the command `npm test`.\n1. Many errors can be fixed automatically with the command `npm run fix`.\n1. After running fix, test again to see what you need to fix manually.\n\nWhen the linter encounters errors, it will report them in the console.\nThe error report will contain the file name and line number, and it will\nindicate the character or place in the line that raised the style violation. To\nfix an error, satisfy the change that the violation indicates.\n\nFor example, here is an error for an invalid variable name style. Variables must\nfollow a camelCase convention.\n\n```sh\n/Users/user1/Documents/github/aria-practices/examples/slider/js/text-slider.js\n  19:8  error  Identifier 'value_nodes' is not in camel case  camelcase\n```\n\nThe error occurred in `examples/slider/js/text-slider.js`, on line 19 and the\noffending character is indicated by the number `8` after the colon. Change the\nvariable `value_nodes` to `valueNodes` in your source file to eliminate this\nerror.\n\nTo see the complete list of style rules that are applied by ESLint, review the [.eslint.json](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/blob/master/.eslint.json) file in the root of the project.\n\n### Editorial documentation\n\nGeneral documentation for editing ARIA deliverables is available in the\n[ARIA repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).\nSome of that documentation covers technical procedures not needed\nfor this specification.\n\n## How to update document snapshot\n\nNote: These instructions are for editors of the APG who have repository commit access.\n\n1. Go to the [editors draft on rawgit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/w3c/aria-practices/master/aria-practices.html)\n2. Press the ReSpec button (top right hand corner)\n3. Select 'Save snapshot'\n4. Select 'Save as HTML'\n5. Open the gh-pages branch of the `aria-practices` repository\n6. Open `index.html` in your preferred editor\n7. Overwrite contents of `index.html` with the snapshot copy you saved\n8. Commit and push changes\n9. Review changes at [GitHub pages APG snapshot](http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/)\n"

            "text": "# ARIA Common Files\n\n[This is the repository for aria-common](https://github.com/w3c/aria-common). It contains files shared by several other ARIA repositories, and copied into those repositories. Note *content must be updated in w3c/aria-common*; changes made in copies are overwritten next time content from this repository is synced.\n\nResources in the common files:\n\n## Terms\n\nThe specifications share a common set of term definitions, located in [terms.html](terms.html). Add and update terms there, keeping in mind your edits will affect all specifications. To use the terms, at the place you want the terms to be included, provide the following line:\n\n```html\n<div data-include=\"../common/terms.html\" data-oninclude=\"restrictReferences\"></div>\n```\n\nThis includes the terms file and filters it to only output ones that are referenced in that particular specification.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nThe Respec processor loads a bibliography called [Specref](https://github.com/tobie/specref). This resource automatically includes most publications that have been published to the W3C Technical Reports page. While it is possible to request additions to this via pull requests, in practice to use references that are not in that database, it is easier to use a [`localBiblio`](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/localBiblio). This allows the Respec configuration to load additional bibliographic entries, structured in the same way as in Specref.\n\nMany of the supplementary bibliographic entries needed for the ARIA publications are common to several specifications. Therefore the bibliographic entries are all stored in [biblio.js](biblio.js). This is loaded with the other scripts at the top of the file with the following line:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../common/biblio.js\" class=\"remove\"></script>\n```\n\nIn the respecConfig, instead of providing the set of bibliographic entries directly, simply reference the object created by that script:\n\n```html\nlocalBiblio: biblio,\n```\n\n## Images, CSS, and Scripts\n\nThe `common` directory also contains shared images, CSS, and scripts. Some of the scripts extend the Respec formatting processor, and others are meant to be used with the final output version. When a resource is, or is likely to be, shared, put it in the common directory. Resources specific to a particular specification, including overriding CSS, can be placed in the directory for that specification. Use the same sub-directory structure of `img`, `css`, and `script` to help keep files organized.\n"

            "text": "\n# Web Authentication Specification\n\nThis is the repository for the W3C WebAuthn Working Group, producing the draft **\"Web Authentication\"** specification.\n\n* [The editor's copy is available at https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), or in the [`gh-pages` branch of this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/blob/gh-pages/index.html).\n  - The current *offically-published working-draft snapshot* [is here: https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/).\n* [The build history is available at Travis-CI.org](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webauthn/builds)\n* [W3C WebAuthn Blog](https://www.w3.org/blog/webauthn/)\n* [Web platform tests repository](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webauthn)\n\n# Contributing\n\nTo materially contribute to this specification, you must meet the requirements outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Also, before submitting feedback, please familiarize yourself with [our current issues list](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues) and review the [mailing list discussion](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/).\n\n# Building the Draft\n\nFormatted HTML for the draft can be built using `bikeshed` (see below for instructions for `bikeshed` installation):\n\n```\n$ bikeshed spec\n```\n\nYou may also want to use the `watch` functionality to automatically regenerate as you make changes:\n\n```\n$ bikeshed watch\n```\n\n# Bikeshed Installation and Setup\n\nYou will need to have the Python tools `pygments` and `bikeshed` to build the draft. Pygments can be obtained via `pip`, but Bikeshed will need to be downloaded with `git`:\n\n```\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git ./bikeshed\npip install pygments\npip install --editable ./bikeshed\ncp -R .spec-data/* ./bikeshed/bikeshed/spec-data\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [Vagrant VM with `bikeshed` already installed](vagrant/bikeshed), or the [Docker image](docker/bikeshed).\n\n\n# Continuous Integration & Branches\n\nThis repository uses `.deploy-output.sh` to generate the Editor's Draft on the `gh-pages` branch upon every merge to `master`. In order to prevent failed merges during continuous integration, the formatted Editor's Draft should not be checked in to `master`, and it is in the `.gitignore` file.\n\n# Creating a new Working Draft\n\nTo build a new WD and upload it to the W3C publishing system:\n- Register as a W3C member and join the Web Authentication working group. Note down your W3C USERNAME and PASSWORD to use in the command below. If you don't remember either one, please go [here](https://www.w3.org/accounts/recover) to retrieve it.\n- Copy the url of the meeting minutes in which the working group decided to publish a new draft as the DECISION_URL to be used below\n- Make sure Bikeshed is installed locally (follow the Bikeshed Installation and Setup section above)\n- Go into the ./bikeshed directory and use git pull to update Bikeshed.\n- Run the following command to update Bikeshed's datafiles: \n```\nbikeshed update\n```\n- Edit the Bikeshed metadata to change the status from ED to WD (do not commit this change)\n- Ensure Bikeshed can compile without any error or warning by running through the following command: \n```\nbikeshed spec\n```\n- Build and upload the new draft with\n```\nbikeshed echidna --u USERNAME --p PASSWORD --d DECISION_URL\n```\n\nThe command above will create a tarball of the HTML and images, and upload to Echidna, W3C's automated publishing system. The command should return a url, thhrough which you can know whether you successfully publish the draft. Status of the request can also be tracked through the [Mailing List Archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tr-notifications/). You can also use W3C API [as described in the Echidna documentation](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna). Note that on Windows, this will give an error about failing to delete a temporary file because it is in use by a different process. This error is harmless; it happens after the submission has completed.\n\nIf the publication through the process is unsuccessful, it's likely because of [Specbreus](https://github.com/w3c/specberus), a spec compliance checker. Echidna automatically runs through Specbreus and will reject the publication if any error is reported by Specbreus. You can run your document through [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) to understand why your document is rejected. You may modify either the index.bs file or the index.html file to ensure compliance. \n\nMore often than not, you will discover the [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) errors are due to bugs in either Bikeshed or Specbreus. If so, you will have to modify the compiled index.html file to bypass Echidna and use the [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) to publish. While you are editing the html file to avoid errors, you should also check to ensure the document still renders correctly.  \n\nThe [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) requires you to first create a tar file. To create the tar file, you need to first copy the index.html file and rename the copied file as Overview.html. This is because Echidna doesn't recognize index.html. You can then use the following command to create a tar file: \n```\ntar -cvf WD.tar Overview.html image1 image2 image3\n```\n\nThen you can run the following command curl to publish to Echidna (use the command at the same directory as your tar file): \n```\ncurl 'https://labs.w3.org/echidna/api/request' --user '<username>:<password>' -F \"tar=@WD.tar\" -F \"decision=<decisionUrl>\"\n```\n\nFeel free to contact your chair or any W3C staff when you are stucked. Overall info on echidna is here: https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki and here https://labs.w3.org/echidna/.\n\n# Taking meeting minutes\n\n* [Scribe instructions from the W3C Guidebook](https://www.w3.org/2008/04/scribe.html)\n* [Alternate instructions from the XML Security WG](https://www.w3.org/2008/xmlsec/Group/Scribe-Instructions.html)\n"

There's no need to be mean or rude.\n* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.\n* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.\n* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term \"harassment\" as including the definition in the <a href=\"http://citizencodeofconduct.org/\">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.\n* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the Daydream WebXR Moderation Team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.\n* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.\n\n## Moderation\n\n\nThese are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the Daydream WebXR members.\n\n1. Remarks that violate the Daydream WebXR standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)\n2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.\n3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.\n4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be \"kicked,\" i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.\n5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.\n6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.\n7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.\n8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.\n\nIn the Daydream WebXR community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.\n\nAnd if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow contributors comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.\n\nThe enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Daydream WebXR venues; this GitHub repository currently; For other projects adopting this Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.\n"

            "text": "# WebVR Polyfill\n\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill)\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/webvr-polyfill.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webvr-polyfill)\n\nA JavaScript implementation of the [WebVR spec][spec]. This project ensures\nyour WebVR content works on any platform, whether or not the browser/device has\nnative WebVR support, or when there are inconsistencies in implementation.\n\nTake a look at [basic WebVR samples][samples] that use this polyfill.\n\n## Installing\n\n### Script\n\nDownload the build at [build/webvr-polyfill.js](build/webvr-polyfill.js) and include it as a script tag,\nor use a CDN. You can also use the minified file in the same location as `webvr-polyfill.min.js`.\n\n```html\n  <script src='webvr-polyfill.js'></script>\n  <!-- or use a link to a CDN -->\n  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webvr-polyfill@latest/build/webvr-polyfill.js'></script>\n```\n\n### npm\n\nIf you're using a build tool like [browserify] or [webpack], install it via [npm].\n\n```\n$ npm install --save webvr-polyfill\n```\n\n## Using\n\nInstructions for using versions `>=0.10.0`. For `<=0.9.x` versions, see [0.9.40 tag](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/tree/v0.9.40).\n\nThe webvr-polyfill exposes a single constructor, `WebVRPolyfill` that takes an\nobject for configuration. See full configuration options at [src/config.js](src/config.js).\n\nBe sure to instantiate the polyfill before calling any of your VR code! The\npolyfill needs to patch the API if it does not exist so your content code can\nassume that the WebVR API will just work.\n\nIf using script tags, a `WebVRPolyfill` global constructor will exist.\n\n```js\nvar polyfill = new WebVRPolyfill();\n```\n\nIn a modular ES6 world, import and instantiate the constructor similarly.\n\n```js\nimport WebVRPolyfill from 'webvr-polyfill';\nconst polyfill = new WebVRPolyfill();\n```\n\nHere's an example of querying displays and setting up controls based on\nenvironment. Remember, you'll still need to provide controls and code\nto support a desktop-like experience if no native VRDisplays are found,\nas the CardboardVRDisplay is only on mobile. See the [example](examples/index.html).\n\n```js\n// Polyfill always provides us with `navigator.getVRDisplays`\nnavigator.getVRDisplays().then(displays => {\n  // If we have a native VRDisplay, or if the polyfill\n  // provided us with a CardboardVRDisplay, use it\n  if (displays.length) {\n    vrDisplay = displays[0];\n    controls = new THREE.VRControls(camera);\n    vrDisplay.requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  } else {\n    // If we don't have a VRDisplay, we're probably on\n    // a desktop environment, so set up desktop-oriented controls\n    controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera);\n    requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### iframes\n\nThere are some concerns and caveats when embedding polyfilled WebVR content inside iframes. [More information is documented in the cardboard-vr-display README](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display#iframes).\n\n## Goals\n\nThe polyfill's goal is to provide a library so that developers can create\ncontent targeting the WebVR API without worrying about what browsers and devices\ntheir users have in a world of growing, [but fragmented](caniuse) support.\n\nThe three main components of the polyfill are:\n\n* Injects a [WebVR 1.1](spec) JavaScript implementation if one does not exist\n* Patches browsers that have an incomplete or inconsistent implementation of the API\n* Provide a synthesized [CardboardVRDisplay] on mobile when WebVR is not supported, or if it does have native support but no native VRDisplays and `PROVIDE_MOBILE_VRDISPLAY` is true (default).\n\n## Performance\n\nPerformance is critical for VR. If you find your application is too sluggish,\nconsider tweaking some of the above parameters. In particular, keeping\n`BUFFER_SCALE` at 0.5 (the default) will likely help a lot.\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you're interested in developing and contributing on the polyfill itself, you'll need to\nhave [npm] installed and familiarize yourself with some commands below. For full list\nof commands available, see `package.json` scripts.\n\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:immersive-web/webvr-polyfill.git\n$ cd webvr-polyfill/\n\n# Install dependencies\n$ npm install\n\n# Build uncompressed JS file\n$ npm run build\n\n# Run tests\n$ npm test\n\n# Watch src/* directory and auto-rebuild on changes\n$ npm watch\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nRight now there are some unit tests in the configuration and logic for how things get polyfilled.\nBe sure to run tests before submitting any PRs, and bonus points for having new tests!\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\nDue to the nature of the polyfill, be also sure to test the examples with your changes where appropriate.\n\n### Releasing a new version\n\nFor maintainers only, to cut a new release for npm, use the [npm version] command. The `preversion`, `version` and `postversion` npm scripts will run tests, build, add built files and tag to git, push to github, and publish the new npm version.\n\n`npm version <semverstring>`\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software for both commercial and non-commercial use,\ndistributed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).\n\n[samples]: https://webvr.info/samples/\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com\n[browserify]: http://browserify.org/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/\n[caniuse]: https://caniuse.com/#search=webvr\n[spec]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1\n[CardboardVRDisplay]: https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display\n"

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

See the [Rules](#rules) section below.\n* `dpi`: The DPI of the device's screen, either as a scalar value or as an array of X and Y DPI. Get this information via the [Device Info App] and look for `Actual DPI X` and `Actual DPI Y` values.\n* `bw`: The bezel width in millimeters, with many phones having between 3 or 4mm bezel widths. See the [Calculating Bezel Width](#calculating-bezel-width) section below.\n* `ac`: The accuracy of this entry. This is not currently used in [webvr-polyfill], but may in the future, and used to settle discrepencies between device reported information versus DPDB data, although this is more for Android apps that have may potentially have access to both API reporting and DPDB results. Can be one of the following values:\n    * `0`: measurements are speculative. Use as fallback only.\n    * `500`: measurements are based on the device's self-reported values, which is often inaccurate. Unless you're physically measuring a device, this is probably the value to use.\n    * `1000`: measurements are based on measuring a physical device.\n\n### Rules\n\nThe `rules` entry is an array of objects, each with one key/value pair, and matches if *any* of the rules match the device.\n\n#### User-Agent\n\nThe `ua` rule is matched with the device's User-Agent string. It is not a regular expression, but just a simple substring match. Go to [useragentstring.com] and find something unique that looks like the device's name. Use this if device type is `\"android\"`. Keep in mind of other models, where a string for the Nexus 5 could match the Nexus 5X, hence a string like `\"Nexus 5 \"` (note the extra space).\n\n```js\n  { \"ua\": \"ASUS_Z00AD\" }\n```\n\n#### MDMH\n\nThe `mdmh` rule matches a device based on manufacturer, device, model, and hardware, as reported by the device's Android API. This rule is only applicable to Android devices running native apps, not the web.\n\n```js\n  { \"mdmh\": \"asus/*/ASUS_Z00AD/*\" }\n```\n\n#### Resolution\n\nThe `res` rule matches a device based on its exact pixel resolution. This should normally only be used on iOS devices because there's a 1:1 mapping between exact resolution and phone model.\n\n```js\n  { \"res\": [640, 960] }\n```\n\n### Calculating Bezel Width\n\nYou can calculate the exact bezel width using this formula, where `deviceWidth` is in millimeters, `screen` is the screen's diagonal length in millimeters, and `ratio` is the screen resolution's `width / height`:\n\n```js\n(deviceWidth - Math.sqrt((screen * screen) / (1 + (1 / (ratio * ratio))))) / 2;\n```\n\n## Scripts\n\nTo generate the `dpdb.json` file from the `dpdb-formatted.json` source file, run this [npm](https://npmjs.org/) script from the command line:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOr call this [Node](https://nodejs.org) script directly:\n\n```sh\nnode scripts/build.js --write\n```\n\n## Change Log\n\nThe following devices were added (and/or corrections made):\n\n### 2019-02-19\n- [iPhone XS Max](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/51)\n\n### 2018-12-10\n- [Pixel 2](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/46)\n- [Pixel 3](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/46)\n- [Pixel 2 XL](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/44)\n- [Pixel 3 XL](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/43)\n\n### 2018-10-17\n- [Samsung S8+ variant](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/41)\n\n### 2018-03-14\n- [iPhone X](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/35)\n\n### 2018-02-07\n- [OnePlus 5T](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/32)\n\n### 2018-01-19\n- [OnePlus 5](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/31)\n- [BENEVE VR5](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/pull/30)\n\n### 2017-10-12\n- [Fly IQ4412](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/28)\n\n### 2017-09-12\n- [Motorola G5 Plus](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/27)\n- [Samsung Note 5 (SM-N920P)](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/26)\n\n### 2017-08-27\n- [Samsung S8](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/25)\n- [Lenovo Phab 2 Pro](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/24)\n\n### 2017-07-09\n- [Samsung S8+](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/issues/23)\n\n### 2017-06-01\n- [Samsung S4](https://github.com/WebVRRocks/webvr-polyfill-dpdb/commit/8e89ba9bc3d2996dd845a005fa0f92b2f768d098)\n\n### 2017-05-22\n- [Google Pixel](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/commit/1da4b02f702bb0e2662ce713a52fb452290f36c1#diff-7c2d4996a1c9e98511cab90ef34c060d)\n\n### 2017-01-19\n- Added format key to avoid 'unexpected format version' error (thanks to [AdrienPoupa](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa) for spotting this oversight)\n\n### 2017-01-12\n- [Google Pixel XL](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2117#issuecomment-263336591)\n- [Motorola G4](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/2117#issuecomment-265275683)\n- [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/164#issuecomment-266108204)\n- [Samsung Note 5 (UA variant)](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/pull/185)\n\n### 2017-01-06\n- [Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill/issues/164#issuecomment-266108204)\n- [iPhone 6S+](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate/issues/146#issuecomment-253711181)\n- Removed double entries for several iOS settings\n\n[webvr-polyfill]: https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill\n[useragentstring.com]: http://useragentstring.com/\n[Device Info App]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jphilli85.deviceinfo\n"

This is the magic\nbehind rendering distorted stereoscopic views for browsers that do not support the [WebVR API]\nwith the [webvr-polyfill].\n\nUnless you're building a WebVR wrapper, you probably want to use [webvr-polyfill] directly\nrather than this. This component **does not** polyfill interfaces like `VRFrameData` and\n`navigator.getVRDisplays`, and up to the consumer, although trivial (see examples).\n\n## How It Works\n\nAs of [1.0.4](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/tree/v1.0.4), `CardboardVRDisplay` uses [RelativeOrientationSensor] for orientation tracking,\nfalling back to [DeviceMotionEvents] using [sensor fusion and pose prediction][fusion].\n[RelativeOrientationSensor] is a new API ([read more about the new Sensors on the web][sensors])\nfirst implemented in Chrome M63. This API uses the new [Feature Policy] specification which allows\ndevelopers to selectively enable or disable browser features.\n\nIt can also render in stereo mode, and includes mesh-based\nlens distortion. This display also includes user interface elements in VR mode\nto make the VR experience more intuitive, including:\n\n* A gear icon to select your VR viewer.\n* A back button to exit VR mode.\n* An interstitial which only appears in portrait orientation, requesting you switch\n  into landscape orientation (if [orientation lock][ol] is not available).\n\n### iframes\n\nBy default, main frames and same-origin iframes have access to Sensor APIs,\nbut cross-origin iframes must specify feature policy and allow `gyroscope` and\n`accelerometer` features. If your experience is attempting to use the native\n[WebXR Device API] in an iframe, you'll have to specify that feature as well ([WebXR's\nfeature name may change](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/308)). All of these features require HTTPS to function, except for `localhost`, where HTTP is allowed.\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://otherdomain.com\" allow=\"gyroscope; accelerometer; xr\"></iframe>\n```\n\nWhile `devicemotion` is a fallback for Sensors, eventually `devicemotion` will be behind the same\nFeature Policy as Sensors and it is encouraged to adhere to these policies in the meantime.\nIf the Feature Policy for Sensors is denied, `CardboardVRDisplay` will **not** always attempt\nto fall back to `devicemotion`. Using Feature Policies now will guarantee a more future-proof experience.\n\n#### Caveats\n\n* On iOS, cross-origin iframes do not have access to the `devicemotion` events.\n  The `CardboardVRDisplay` however does respond to events passed in from a parent\n  frame via `postMessage`. See the [iframe example][iframe-example] to see how\n  the events must be formatted.\n* Chrome M63 supports Sensors, although not the corresponding Feature Policy [until Chrome M65][sensors-main-frame].\n  This results in Chrome M63/M64 only supporting Sensors in main frames, and these browsers\n  will fall back to using devicemotion if in iframes.\n* Using Sensors in a cross-origin iframe [requires the frame to be in focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/#focused-area). In builds of Chrome prior to M69, this logic is [erroneously reversed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=849501). If loading content via cross-origin iframe, you can disable Sensors, triggering the `devicemotion` fallback with this [hacky workaround](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/blob/c196e15a8c7ccf594fe6a5044fbdcb51cc2eff91/examples/index.html#L117-L124). More info in [#27](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display/issues/27).\n\n### Magic Window\n\nIt is possible to have a magic window using a VRDisplay that isn't 100% width/height of the window, and can jump into fullscreen WebVR. See the [magic window][magicwindow-example] for usage.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install --save cardboard-vr-display\n```\n\n## Browser Support\n\nShould support most modern browsers (IE11 is missing a few, for example) and requires [ES5](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) JavaScript support. If you want to support a non-ES5 browser, or browser lacking some DOM globals, you must use a transformation or provide polyfills to support older environments.\n\nGlobals required:\n\n* [`Promise`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises)\n* [`CustomEvent`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=customevent)\n* [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=requestanimationframe)\n\nAdditionally, WebGL support, [`devicemotion`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=deviceorientation) events, and common browser globals (`window`, `navigator`, `document`) are also required in the environment.\n\n## Usage\n\n`cardboard-vr-display` exposes a constructor for a `CardboardVRDisplay` that takes\na single options configuration, detailed below. Check out [running the demo](#running-the-demo)\nto try the different options.\n\n```js\nimport CardboardVRDisplay from 'cardboard-vr-display';\n\n// Default options\nconst options = {\n  // Optionally inject custom Viewer parameters as an option.

            "text": "# Immersive Web Community Group Proposals Repo\n\n## What is this repo for?\n\nThis repo serves as a discussion board for additions and improvements to Immersive Web standards.\n\nWhile much of our work to date has been on the WebXR Device API, this repo also holds proposals for features that could end up in other standards.\n\nIf your proposal isn't in some way related to Immersive Web technologies like Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality then head over to the [W3C Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/) to find an appropriate group. The [Web Incubator Community Group (WICG)](https://wicg.io/) is also a good general-purpose venue.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n**TL;DR: Treat other participants with respect or get banned.**\n\nThis repository is for *open discussion of ideas* for making the Immersive Web better and we foster an environment where all discussion is respectful. Every person participating in the community group is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/immersive-web/community-resources/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## How does a feature idea become a standard?\n\nAn immersive web feature goes through several steps to move from idea to standard:\n\n- File a Proposals Issue\n- Find Consensus for the Idea\n- Recruit Feature Advocates\n- Create a Feature Repo\n- Write an Explainer\n- Find Consensus for Feature Details\n- Recruit Implementers\n- Pitch to a Working Group\n\n**Most of the work of landing a feature is social, not technical.**\n\nIf you're reading this, you probably have ideas about what \"should\" be in the Immersive Web. Welcome, there are a lot of dreamers in our community!\n\nThat said, landing a feature in a standard consists mostly of writing documents, having conversations, and eventually finding consensus for an idea. You'll need to rally support from people who can make prototypes, write documentation, and then as a group you'll work to convince a working group that the feature is important enough to take through the W3C standard.\n\n## I have a proposal! How do I get started?\n\nGreat! If the paragraphs above haven't scared you off, you're up for the social work of standardization, and you haven't found related Issues through a search, then file a GitHub Issue in the [proposals repo](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues) using the [Proposals Issue Template](ProposalsIssueTemplate.md).\n\nThat Issue will be the place where you host discussion about the feature until one of two things happen:\n\nBest case: You find other people (ideally implementers) who have the time and interest to engage with the feature idea and as a group you find a general agreement about what it is, how it should work, and the rough shape of the API design or other technical artifact.\n\nCommon case: People agree that the feature is interesting but you don't gain much momentum and nobody steps up to work on the feature. The issue discussion goes stagnant and a chair may close it. It will be in the archive in case interest is re-animated and someone steps up to be the feature.\n\nA community group chair can help if you get stuck in this step. A big part of their responsibilities is to help people in the CG connect with like-minded members to work through proposals. If you feel that your proposal isn't getting the attention it deserves then reach out! A chair can't do the work for you, but they can help you understand what needs to be done and who else might be interested.\n\n## My proposal Issue has widespread support and we've found consensus. Now what?\n\nTerrific! You did the hard work of getting enough momentum in the group to figure out what you're making and how it would work. The next step is to recruit one or two people from other organizations who want to join you as feature advocates. This isn't a formal W3C community group role; it simply means that each of you agrees to do the work of nailing down a feature's details and working with the rest of the group to find consensus on its details.\n\nOnce two or three people from separate organizations have volunteered to work on the feature then you should reach out to a CG chair and ask that a feature repo be created.\n\n## A CG chair made a new feature repo. Now what?\n\nOne goal of the repo is to work through the specific details of a feature with enough detail that it's clearly possible to implement and it's attractive to the relevant Working Group.\n\nThe other (perhaps more important) goal of the repo is to attract the attention of implementers and topic experts and then find consensus for the feature details.\n\nFeature advocates (mentioned in the paragraphs above) are on the hook to do both technical and social work. It can take **a lot** of effort to gather enough feedback from a wide enough range of people that your feature will work for the entire immersive web.\n\nYou start by writing an explainer document that lays out the context for the feature, captures the main discussion points from the proposals Issue, and runs through a few possible shapes that the feature's API or other technical artifacts could take. The goal of this document is to give readers the information they need to decide whether they want to work on the feature.\n\nAgain, if you get stuck on this step (either in the writing or in the social aspects) then reach out to a CG chair. \n\n## Our feature repo has all of the details needed to implement a feature. Now what?\n\nExcellent! You've talked to enough of the community and worked together as feature advocates to nail down pretty much everything that one would need to know in order to implement a feature.\n\nIf you've been prototyping the feature during the process of nailing down the design, you're probably in good shape. If not, you'll need to find someone to write code to prove out the design so that you can make the case that the feature is definitely ready to use in production.\n\nIdeally, you'll have prototypes that work on different platforms so it's clear that the feature is not a solution for just one vendor.\n\nDuring this process you should reach out to a CG chair and start the work of finding or creating a W3C working group that is a good fit for the feature.\n\n## Our feature's details are nailed down and we have working prototypes. Now what?\n\nAt this point, you've reached the end of what the community group can do. Now you have to convince a working group to take on your feature and turn it into a standard. All of the community rallying, document writing, and prototyping comes together to convince the W3C that this feature is important and good to go.  \n\nIn the previous step (see the question above) you'll have reached out to a CG chair to find or create a working group. The working group will have its own process for taking on new features, so you and a CG chair will work with a WG chair to start that process. \n"

For example, a web application may wish to detect a horizontal plane (e.g, the floor) in the camera feed, and render an object (e.g, a chair) on that plane.\n\nThere are many ways that real-world geometry could be exposed through a web API. We propose starting by adding a hit-test API. This API would allow the developer to cast a ray into the real world and return a list of intersection points for that ray against whatever world understanding the underlying system gathers.\n\nThis approach abstracts the understanding of the world with a high level primitive that will work across many underlying technologies. A hit-test API would unlock a significant number of use cases for AR while allowing the work to expose other types of world understanding in a web-friendly way to proceed in parallel.\n\nFor more information about this proposal, please read the [explainer](explainer.md) and issues/PRs.\n"

            "text": "# WebXR Polyfill\n\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill)\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/webxr-polyfill.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webxr-polyfill)\n\nA JavaScript implementation of the [WebXR Device API][webxr-spec]. This polyfill allows developers to write against the latest specification, providing support when run on browsers that implement the [WebVR 1.1 spec][webvr-spec], or no WebVR/WebXR support at all.\n\n:warning: **The WebXR Device API is still in flux** :warning:\n\nThe polyfill will be updated to track changes in the spec, and may introduce breaking changes in the polyfill's `1.0.x` releases until the spec stabilizes.\n\n---\n\nIf you are writing code against the [WebVR 1.1 spec][webvr-spec], use [webvr-polyfill], which supports browsers with the 1.0 spec, or no implementation at all. It is recommended to write your code targeting the [WebXR Device API spec][webxr-spec] however and use this polyfill as browsers begin to implement the latest changes.\n\nThe minimal input controls currently supported by WebXR is polyfilled here as well, using the [Gamepad API][gamepad-api].\n\n## Setup\n\n### Installing\n\nDownload the build at [build/webxr-polyfill.js](build/webxr-polyfill.js) and include it as a script tag,\nor use a CDN. You can also use the minified file in the same location as `webxr-polyfill.min.js`.\n\n```html\n  <script src='webxr-polyfill.js'></script>\n  <!-- or use a link to a CDN -->\n  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webxr-polyfill@latest/build/webxr-polyfill.js'></script>\n```\n\nOr if you're using a build tool like [browserify] or [webpack], install it via [npm].\n\n```\n$ npm install --save webxr-polyfill\n```\n\n### Using\n\nThe webxr-polyfill exposes a single constructor, `WebXRPolyfill` that takes an\nobject for configuration. See full configuration options at [API](#api).\n\nBe sure to instantiate the polyfill before calling any of your XR code! The\npolyfill needs to patch the API if it does not exist so your content code can\nassume that the WebXR API will just work.\n\nIf using script tags, a `WebXRPolyfill` global constructor will exist.\n\n```js\nvar polyfill = new WebXRPolyfill();\n```\n\nIn a modular ES6 world, import and instantiate the constructor similarly.\n\n```js\nimport WebXRPolyfill from 'webxr-polyfill';\nconst polyfill = new WebXRPolyfill();\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new WebXRPolyfill(global, config)\n\nTakes a `global` object (usually `window`), as well as a `config` object with\nthe following options:\n\n* `webvr`: Whether or not there should be an attempt to fall back to a\n  WebVR 1.1 VRDisplay. (default: `true`).\n* `cardboard`: Whether or not there should be an attempt to fall back to a\n  JavaScript implementation of the WebXR API only on mobile. (default: `true`)\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThere are 3 builds provided: [build/webxr-polyfill.js](build/webxr-polyfill.js), an ES5 transpiled build, its minified counterpart [build/webxr-polyfill.min.js](build/webxr-polyfill.min.js), and an untranspiled [ES Modules] version [build/webxr-polyfill.module.js](build/webxr-polyfill.module.js). If using the transpiled ES5 build, its up to developers to decide which browser features to polyfill based on their support, as no extra polyfills are included. Some browser features this library uses include:\n\n* TypedArrays\n* Object.assign\n* Promise\n* Symbol\n* Map\n* Array#includes\n\nCheck the [.babelrc](.babelrc) configuration and ensure the polyfill runs in whatever browsers you choose to support.\n\n## Polyfilling Rules\n\n* If `'xr' in navigator === false`:\n  * WebXR classes (e.g. `XRDevice`, `XRSession`) will be added to the global\n  * `navigator.xr` will be polyfilled.\n  * If the platform has a `VRDisplay` from the [WebVR 1.1 spec][webvr-spec] available:\n    * `navigator.xr.requestDevice()` will return a polyfilled `XRDevice` wrapping the `VRDisplay`.\n  * If the platform does not have a `VRDisplay`, `config.cardboard === true`, and on mobile:\n    * `navigator.xr.requestDevice()` will return a polyfilled `XRDevice` based on [CardboardVRDisplay].\n  * If `WebGLRenderingContext.prototype.setCompatibleXRDevice` is not a function:\n    * Polyfill all `WebGLRenderingContext.prototype.setCompatibleXRDevice` and a creation attribute\nfor `{ compatibleXrDevice }`.\n    * Polyfills `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext` to support a `xrpresent` type. Returns a polyfilled `XRPresentationContext` (via `CanvasRenderingContext2D` or `ImageBitmapRenderingContext` if supported) used for mirroring and magic window.\n* If `'xr' in navigator === true`, `config.cardboard === true` and on mobile:\n  * Overwrite `navigator.xr.requestDevice` so that a native `XRDevice` is returned if it exists, and if not, return a polyfilled `XRDevice` based on [CardboardVRDisplay].\n\nIn the future, when the WebXR API is implemented on a platform but inconsistent with spec (due to new spec changes or inconsistencies), the polyfill will attempt to patch these differences without overwriting the native behavior.\n\n## Not supported/Caveats\n\n* A lot of objects should only be used in the frame they were retrieved; don't save and access a XRDevice's `poseModelMatrix` in a frame other than when it was created.\n* `XRWebGLLayer.multiview`\n* `XRWebGLLayer.framebufferScaleFactor` and `XRWebGLLayer.requestViewportScaling()`\n\n## License\n\nThis program is free software for both commercial and non-commercial use,\ndistributed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).\n\n[webxr-spec]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/\n[webvr-spec]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/\n[webvr-polyfill]: https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com\n[browserify]: http://browserify.org/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/\n[ES Modules]: https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/\n[CardboardVRDisplay]: https://immersive-web.github.io/cardboard-vr-display\n[gamepad-api]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API\n"

Display the motion controller's virtual model at the correct location\n1. Find out the state of the controller's component parts (made up of buttons and axes)\n1. Modify the virtual model to reflect the state of the components each render frame\n1. Provide a key or legend that explains the mapping of components to actions\n\nThe state of an XR motion controller's buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, and touchpads is made available to developers via a `Gamepad` object, as defined by the [Gamepad API](https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/). This data is divided up and populated in the `Gamepad.buttons` array and the `Gamepad.axes` array. While this system was adequate for the relatively homogenous console gaming controllers, it breaks down for XR motion controllers as they have not yet converged on a common form factor. In addition, the [Gamepad API](https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) does not provide any information about the visualization of a `Gamepad` object which is a requirement to displaying a virtual copy of motion controller on opaque XR headsets.\n\n## Overview\nThis repository defines a JSON schema to bridge the gap between the needs listed above and the abstract data reported by `Gamepad` objects. For each known motion controller, there is a folder in this repository at either `./mappings/WebXR/<Gamepad.id>/` or `./mappings/WebVR/<Gamepad.id>/` depending on the type of `Gamepad`.  In this folder is a `mapping.json` file which enumerates how to interpret the `Gamepad` data, paths to included 3D asset files representing the `Gamepad`, and the metadata necessary bind them together. Assets are available under MIT license in .glTF or .glB  format with a schema extension to be defined so additional formats may also be made available in the future.\n\n## Design Goals\nThis repository has been designed to meet the following goals:\n* *Distributable and modifiable.* The content in this repository is available under MIT licence.  Take this schema and modify it for your own purposes.\n* *Forward compatible.* The schema, validation tests, and tools are designed to make it straightforward to submit a pull request with new mapping files and assets as new XR hardware comes on the market.  Additionally, fallback assets and mappings are included to handle unknown motion controllers.\n* *No custom code necessary.* The schema enables enumerating all hardware metadata necessary to write a single code path for handling motion controller hardware.  Developers should not need to add code checks for specific `Gamepad.id` as aberrant user agent behavior is also documentable in the schema as bugs are discovered.\n* *WebXR optimized, WebVR compatible.* While WebVR is still available in several user agents, the future of XR on the web is in the standards-track API, WebXR. As such, when faced with tradeoffs, the design was optimized to simplify the schema for WebXR usage while still maintaining a path for WebVR usage.\n\n## Adding New Hardware\n> **TODO** fill in the steps for adding a folder for a new XR device, testing the change, and submitting for PR\n\n> **TODO** Create an issue template for new hardware PRs\n\n## Filing A Bug\n> **TODO** fill in the steps for filing a bug\n\n> **TODO** Create an issue template for bugs\n\n# Schema\n![Diagram of top-level schema parts](./figures/Concepts.png)\n\n## Data Sources\nMotion controllers are made up of various parts such as thumbsticks, touchpads, triggers, buttons, or dpads.  The [Gamepad API](https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) communicates the state of these parts via the `Gamepad.buttons` array and the `Gamepad.axes` array. However, a single physical part is divided into separate, unrelated attributes. \n\nFor example, a thumbstick's left-right motion is communicated as a double value in an entry in the `Gamepad.axes` array while the top-bottom motion is in a separate `Gamepad.axes` entry. Furthermore if the thumbstick can be clicked straight down, that pressed/touched/value information is communicated by a `GamepadButton` in the `Gamepad.buttons` array.  The `Gamepad` does not provide any indication that these three array entries are related in any way, despite all representing different aspects of the same physical part.\n\nEach element in the `dataSources` array provides the missing information necessary to group the related parts of a `Gamepad` object back together.  All entries in the `dataSources` array must include an `id` property which is unique among all other entries in the array.  For clarity sake, a `dataSourceType` is also included to indicate which subschema is being used to describe the physical properties of a single part.\n\n### Buttons\nA single button (including analog triggers and touchable thumbrests) is represented by an entry in the `dataSources` array with the `dataSourceType` property set to `buttonSource`.  It must also include a `buttonIndex` property with a value representing the index in the `Gamepad.buttons` array at which to find the button's data.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"gripButton\",\n            \"dataSourceType\" : \"buttonSource\",\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 2\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen representing an analog button such as a trigger, the `analogValues` property must be present and set to `true`.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"triggerButton\",\n            \"dataSourceType\" : \"buttonSource\",\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 0,\n            \"analogValues\" : true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen representing a button that can report a touched state but not a pressed state (eg. the thumbrest on the Oculus Touch), the `pressUnsupported` property must be present and set to `true`.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"thumbrest\",\n            \"dataSourceType\" : \"buttonSource\",\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 5,\n            \"pressUnsupported\" : true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Dpads\nA dpad is a physical part that rocks in two directions, left-right and top-bottom button. These parts are built such that only adjacent directions can be depressed at the same time.  For example, a dpad could be pressed in the top and left directions at the same time, but could not be pressed in the left and right directions at the same time.\n\nThe `standard` mapping defined in the [Gamepad API](https://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/#remapping) suggests that dpad parts should be divided into four separate entries in the `Gamepad.buttons` array.  It has been observed, however, that some hardware may report dpads as two entries in the `Gamepad.axes` array instead.  As a result, this schema provides two different subschemas that may be used to represent dpads.\n\n#### Dpads From Buttons\nA data source of this type is defined as one with the `dataSourceType` property set to `dpadFromButtonsSource`. It must include `leftButtonIndex`, `rightButtonIndex`, `topButtonIndex`, and `bottomButtonIndex` properties with values representing the indices in the `Gamepad.buttons` array at which to find the related data.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"dpad\",\n            \"type\": \"dpadFromButtonsSource\",\n            \"leftButtonIndex\" : 3,\n            \"rightButtonIndex\" : 4,\n            \"bottomButtonIndex\" : 5,\n            \"topButtonIndex\" : 6\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, if any of the `GamepadButton` entries referenced by this data source are capable of reporting analog values, the `analogValues` property must be present and set to `true`.\n\n#### Dpads From Axes\nA data source of this type is defined as one with the `dataSourceType` property set to `dpadFromAxesSource`. It must include `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` properties with values representing the indices in the `Gamepad.axes` array at which to find the related data.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"dpad\",\n            \"type\": \"dpadFromAxesSource\",\n            \"xAxisIndex\" : 2,\n            \"yAxisIndex\" : 3\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Thumbsticks And Touchpads\nThumbsticks are a physical part sticking up from the surface of a controller which can be rocked left/right and top/bottom with a circular range.  Often, thumbsticks can also be depressed in a button-like manner.  Touchpads are a physical part, usually circular, that are able to detect the position of a finger placed on their surface.  Often, touchpads can be depressed in the middle in a button-lime manner or at the edges in a dpad-like manner.\n\nBoth thumbsticks and touchpads are represented by an entry in the `dataSources` array with the `dataSourceType` property set to `thumbstickSource` and `touchpadSource` respectively.  Both variations must include `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` properties with values representing the indices in the `Gamepad.axes` array at which to find the related data.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"touchpad\",\n            \"type\": \"touchpadSource\",\n            \"xAxisIndex\" : 0,\n            \"yAxisIndex\" : 1\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nSome thumbsticks and touchpads may be able to be depressed or they may also have a center deadzone in which axis data isn't reported but a \"touched\" status is.  In both cases, the data source must also include a `buttonIndex` property with a value representing the index in the `Gamepad.buttons` array at which to find the button's data. On touchpads with a dpad-like physical behavior, the x-axis and y-axis values can be used to determine which quadrant(s) are being pressed. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"thumbstick\",\n            \"type\": \"thumbstickSource\",\n            \"xAxisIndex\" : 0,\n            \"yAxisIndex\" : 1,\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 1\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIf the thumbstick or touchpad is able to be depressed in an analog manner, the data source must also include an `analogButtonValues` property with a value of `true`.  If the thumbstick or touchpad is capable of reporting a deadzone \"touched\" status but cannot be pressed, the data source must also include a `pressUnsupported` property with a value of `true`.\n\n## Visual Responses\nThe visual representation of a motion controller in a VR must respond to reflect its physical state in the real-world.  For example, when a physical thumbstick is moved to the left, the virtual thumbstick should also move to the left.  The `visualResponses` array contains descriptions of all visual changes that can occur when a controller part is considered \"pressed\" or touched\".  Each element in this array must contain a `target` property which references a node in the asset to be modified.  It must also contain an `onTouch` property, and `onPress` property, or both.  \n\nThe `onPress` and `onTouch` properties must always contain a `degreesOfFreedom` property which describes the degrees of freedom the visual response will contain.  For example, an thumbstick with a button would have `3` degrees of freedom because it can rotate around two axes and translate along a third. The schema supports 1, 2, or 3 degrees of freedom and requires one of the following groups of additional properties based on the value of `degreesOfFreedom`.  The associated javascript library will report the weight to be applied to the values of each of these nodes based on the current state of the associated `dataSource`.\n1. `button`\n2. `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top`\n3. `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top`, and `button`\n\nWhen the `visualResponse` associated with a `dataSource` is in the \"pressed\" state and the `visualResponse` has an `onPress` property then the `onPress` property should be applied to the `target`.  When the `visualResponse` associated with a `dataSource` is in the \"touched\" state and the `visualResponse` has an `onTouch` property then the `onTouch` property should be applied to the `target`.  A fallback behavior should also be applied such that the `onTouch` property is applied if no `onPress` is present in the `visualResponse` and the `dataSource` is in the \"pressed\" state.\n\n### Button Visual Responses\nA `buttonSource` is considered \"pressed\" when the associated `GamepadButton.pressed` value is true and considered \"touched\" when the associated `GamepadButton.touched` value is true. Visual responses for button parts are expected to interpolate `target` properties based on the associated `GamepadButton.value` attribute. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"visualResponses\" : [\n        {\n            \"target\" : \"trigger-root\",\n            \"onTouch\": {\n                \"degreesOfFreedom\": 1,\n                \"button\" : \"trigger-transform-button\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Dpad Visual Responses\nPhysical dpad parts rock around a central pivot, requiring their visual responses to interpolate between `left` and `right` as well as `bottom` and `top`.  The expected interpolation is different when associated based on a `dpadFromButtonSource` as opposed to a `dpadFromAxesSource`.  When associated with the former, `right` is weighted by the `GamepadButton.value` associated with the `rightButtonIndex`, `bottom` is weighted by the `GamepadButton.value` associated with the `bottomButtonIndex`, and so on.  When associated with the latter type of data source, the algorithm is a bit more complicated.  Only positive values in `Gamepad.axes` array at the `xAxisIndex` position are used for interpolation with the `right` node whereas only the absolute value of negative values are used for interpolation with the `left` node.  The same behavior applies to `top` and `bottom` regarding the data at the `yAxisIndex` in the `Gamepad.axes` array. In this manner, both types of data sources can be associated with a single type of visual response.\n\nThe primary difference between `dpadFromButtonsSource` and `dpadFromAxesSource` is how the \"pressed\" or \"touched\" states are determined.  The former is considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" if any of the associated `GamepadButton.touched` or `GamedpadButton.pressed` values are true respectively.  The latter is considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" if the absolute value of either axis is over a touched value threshold or a pressed value threshold respectively.  These two values are defined within the associated javascript library.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"visualResponses\" : [\n        {\n            \"target\" : \"dpad-root\",\n            \"onTouch\" : {\n                \"degreesOfFreedom\": 2,\n                \"left\" : \"dpad-transform-leftmost\",\n                \"right\" : \"dpad-transform-rightmost\",\n                \"bottom\" : \"dpad-transform-bottommost\",\n                \"top\" : \"dpad-transform-topmost\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Thumbstick Visual Responses\nThumbsticks share physical characteristics with dpad, though they typically have a wider range of motion and may also be clickable.  For interpolating the `target` properties, only positive values in `Gamepad.axes` array at the `xAxisIndex` position are used with the `right` node, whereas only the absolute value of negative values are used with the `left` node.  The same behavior applies to `top` and `bottom` regarding the data at the `yAxisIndex` in the `Gamepad.axes` array. If clickable, `target` properties are also interpolated with `buttonMin` and `buttonMax` based on `GamepadButton.value`.\n\nIf the `thumbstickSource` has a `buttonIndex`, the associated `GamepadButton.touched` and `GamepadButton.pressed` will cause the `dataSource` to be considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" respectively.  In addition, similar to the `dpadFromAxesSource`, a `thumbstickSource` may also be considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" if the absolute value of either axis is over a touched value threshold or a pressed value threshold respectively. These two values are defined within the associated javascript library.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"visualResponses\" : [\n        {\n            \"target\" : \"thumbstick-root\",\n            \"onTouch\" : {\n                \"degreesOfFreedom\": 3,\n                \"button\" : \"thumbstick-transform-button\",\n                \"left\" : \"thumbstick-transform-leftmost\",\n                \"right\" : \"thumbstick-transform-rightmost\",\n                \"bottom\" : \"thumbstick-transform-bottommost\",\n                \"top\" : \"thumbstick-transform-topmost\",\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Touchpad Visual Responses\nTouchpads share physical characteristics with dpad, though they may also be clickable.  Whereas all other data source types may use an `onTouch` property for all visualizations, `touchpadSources` will most likely only use an `onTouch` visualization to represent the touch-dot of the user's finger on the part.  Any motion of the touchpad itself due to being clickable, will likely be represented the `onPress` property.\n\nIn either case, the algorithm for interpolating the `target` properties is roughly the same.  Only positive values in `Gamepad.axes` array at the `xAxisIndex` position are used with the `right` node, whereas only the absolute value of negative values are used with the `left` node.  The same behavior applies to `top` and `bottom` regarding the data at the `yAxisIndex` in the `Gamepad.axes` array. If clickable, response visualizations with a `userAction` set to `onPress` may also interpolate `buttonMin` and `buttonMax` based on `GamepadButton.value`.  For example:\n\nIf the `touchpadSource` has a `buttonIndex`, the associated `GamepadButton.touched` and `GamepadButton.pressed` will cause the `dataSource` to be considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" respectively.  In addition, similar to the `dpadFromAxesSource`, a `touchpadSource` may also be considered \"touched\" or \"pressed\" if the absolute value of either axis is over a touched value threshold or a pressed value threshold respectively. These two values are defined within the associated javascript library.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"visualResponses\" : [\n        {\n            \"target\" : \"touchpadDot-root\",\n            \"onTouch\" : {\n                \"degreesOfFreedom\": 2,\n                \"left\" : \"touchpadDot-transform-leftmost\",\n                \"right\" : \"touchpadDot-transform-rightmost\",\n                \"bottom\" : \"touchpadDot-transform-bottommost\",\n                \"top\" : \"touchpadDot-transform-topmost\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"target\" : \"touchpad-root\",\n            \"onPress\" : {\n                \"button\" : \"touchpad-transform-button\",\n                \"left\" : \"touchpad-transform-leftmost\",\n                \"right\" : \"touchpad-transform-rightmost\",\n                \"bottom\" : \"touchpad-transform-bottommost\",\n                \"top\" : \"touchpad-transform-topmost\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Components\nComponents connect a dataSource with the information necessary to correctly visualize it. A component must contain a `dataSource` property which points to an index in the file's `dataSources` array. It must also contain a `root` property which references the topmost node in an asset hierarchy that is associated with the physical part. A component must also contain a `labelTransform` property which references a node in the asset hierarchy at which a legend label could be placed.  It is expected that this node is located a safe distance from the body of the motion controller and oriented in a position appropriate for a label to be read.\n\nFor example, here is component mapping for a single button.\n```json\n{\n    \"components\" : [\n        {\n            \"dataSource\" : 4,\n            \"root\" : \"trigger-root\",\n            \"labelTransform\" : \"trigger-label-transform\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"triggerButton\",\n            \"dataSourceType\" : \"buttonSource\",\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 2\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, most components will also include the `visualResponses` array property.  The elements of this array are indices into the file's `visualResponses` array.  For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"components\" : [\n        {\n            \"dataSource\" : 4,\n            \"root\" : \"trigger-root\",\n            \"labelTransform\" : \"trigger-label-transform\",\n            \"visualResponses\" : [0]\n        }\n    ],\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"triggerButton\",\n            \"dataSourceType\" : \"buttonSource\",\n            \"buttonIndex\" : 2\n        }\n    ],\n    \"visualResponses\" : [\n        {\n            \"userAction\": \"onTouch\",\n            \"target\" : \"trigger-root\",\n            \"buttonMin\" : \"trigger-transform-buttonMin\",\n            \"buttonMax\" : \"trigger-transform-buttonMax\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Handedness\nHandedness objects connect component parts with the information necessary to correctly visualize entire motion controllers.  The `handedness` object must be populated by properties in one of the following configurations:\n\n* *`left` and `right`.* This option should be used when the underlying XR platform is expected to always report a handedness.  This may be because the motion controllers are intrinsically unique such as the Oculus Touch.  It may also be due to a system-level configuration setting which causes an intrinsically unhanded controller to report itself as either left or right such as the Google Daydream Controller.\n* *`none`.* This option should be used for motion controllers which are incapable of reporting handedness.  It does not imply that only one motion controller will be tracked at a time.\n* *`none`, `left`, and `right`.* This options should be used for motion controllers that are capable of but not guaranteed to report handedness. For example, HTC Vive Controllers are not intrinsically handed, but the underlying XR system is able to interpret usage based on relative position over time.  As a result, these controllers are capable of reporting all three types of handedness.\n\nAll three of these properties are the same type and must contain an `asset`, a `root`, and a `components` property.  The `asset` property points to a .glTF or .glB file representing the motion controller; extensions will be made available for additional file formats.  The `root` property references the topmost node in the asset hierarchy associated with the motion controller.  The `components` array must not be empty and contains indices into the file's `components` array.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"handedness\" : {\n        \"none\" : {\n            \"asset\" : \"some-url\",\n            \"root\" : \"none-handedness-controller\",\n            \"components\" : [0]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `none`, `left`, and `right` objects may also contain two additional properties.  When present, the `primaryButtonComponent` property contains the index into the file's `components` array at which position the motion controller's \"default\" button can be found.  For many motion controllers this is a trigger-style button.  When present, the `primaryAxesComponent` property contains the index into the file's `components` array at which position the motion controller's \"default\" thumbstick or touchpad can be found.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"handedness\" : {\n        \"none\" : {\n            \"asset\" : \"some-url\",\n            \"root\" : \"none-handedness-controller\",\n            \"components\" : [0],\n            \"primaryButtonComponent\" : 0,\n            \"primaryAxisComponent\" : 1\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Top-level Properties\nIn addition to `handedness`, `components`, `dataSources`, and `visualResponses` the schema defines two more top-level properties: `version` and `id`.  The `version` property is a semantic version made up of major and minor version parts.  The major and minor version parts must always be up to date with the library being used to parse the mapping file.  The `id` property must match the `Gamepad.id` of the `Gamepad` object the mapping is being applied to.  The naming conventions for the `WebXR Device API` are concretely defined; the naming conventions for `WebVR` are somewhat more haphazard.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\" : \"0.1\",\n    \"id\" : \"motion-controller-id\"\n}\n```\n\n## WebVR\nWhile the main focus of this repo is for future WebXR support, the general design is also applicable to WebVR with a few small additions.  Mapping files for WebVR gamepads must be located at `./mappings/WebVR/<Gamepad.id>/` and the `mapping.json` file must include the top-level property `webVR` set to true.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"webVR\": true\n}\n```\n\n### TargetRay origin\nThe WebXR API communicates the origin of a motion controller's targeting ray through the `XRInputSource.targetRaySpace`, but the WebVR API does not have any mechanism to communicate the same concept.  To account for this, WebVR motion controllers assets must contain an additional    node to indicate the location of the targeting ray's origin relative to the motion controller's root. This node must be referenced in the `handedness` descriptions by including the `webVR_targetRayOrigin` property.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"webVR\": true,\n    \"handedness\": {\n        \"none\": {\n            \"asset\" : \"some-url\",\n            \"root\" : \"none-handedness-controller\",\n            \"webVR_targetRayOrigin\": \"target-ray-origin-node\",\n            \"components\" : [0],\n            \"primaryButtonComponent\" : 0,\n            \"primaryAxisComponent\" : 1\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Axis Inversion\nCertain WebVR `Gamepad` objects have some components with an inverted `yAxis` causing positive `yAxis` values map to the `top` and negative ones map to `bottom`.  Mapping files can indicate this, or an inverted `xAxis`, on a `dataSource` by setting the `webVR_yAxisInverted` or `webVR_xAxisInverted` to true.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"webVR\": true,\n    \"dataSources\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"invertedThumbstick\",\n            \"buttonIndex\": 0,\n            \"xAxisIndex\": 0,\n            \"yAxisIndex\": 1,\n            \"webVR_yAxisInverted\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"invertedThumbstick2\",\n            \"xAxisIndex\": 2,\n            \"yAxisIndex\": 3,\n            \"webVR_xAxisInverted\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n# Source Library\nThis repo provides a javascript library for interpreting the `mapping.json` files and binding them to a live `Gamepad` object.  Developers can uses this library to interact with the conceptual components of the gamepad, rather than each individual button or axis.  \n\n## Connection and Disconnection\nIn order to use this library, developers create a new `XRGamepad` by passing it the associated mapping file, the live `Gamepad` object, and an indication of which `handedness` should be applied.  The initialization path for a WebXR gamepad is slightly different than for a WebVR gamepad for several reasons.  First, newly connected gamepads are reported in WebXR through the `XRSession.inputsourceschange` event where as in WebVR they are reported through the `navigator.gamepadconnected` event.  Second, the handedness is passed separately due to the fact that in WebXR handedness is a property of the `XRInputSource`, whereas in WebVR handedness is a property of the `Gamepad`.\n\n### WebXR Connection and Disconnection\nThis sample code shows creating an `XRGamepad` based on the `XRInputSource.gamepad` property for all newly connected `XRInputSource` objects.  When an `XRInputSource` is disconnected the `XRGamepad` is released.\n\n```js\nlet xrGamepads = {};\nxrSession.addEventListener('inputsourceschange', onInputSourcesChange);\n\nfunction onInputSourcesChange(event) {\n  event.added.forEach((inputSource) => {\n    if (inputSource.gamepad) {\n      let mapping = XRGamepad.getMapping(gamepad.id, XRMappingConstants.MappingType.WebXR);\n      let xrGamepad = new XRGamepad(gamepad, mapping, inputSource.handedness);\n      xrGamepads[inputSource] = xrGamepad;\n    }\n  }\n\n  event.removed.forEach((inputSource) => {\n    if (xrGamepads[inputSource]) {\n      delete xrGamepads[inputSource];\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### WebVR Connection and Disconnection\nThis sample code shows creating an `XRGamepad` for all newly connected `Gamepad` objects associated with WebVR.  When an associated `Gamepad` is disconnected the `XRGamepad` is released.\n\n```js\nlet xrGamepads = {};\nnavigator.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', onGamepadConnected);\nnavigator.addEventListener('gamepaddisconnected', onGamepadDisconnected);\n\nfunction onGamepadConnected(event) {\n  let gamepad = event.gamepad;\n  if (gamepad.deviceId) {\n    let mapping = XRGamepad.getMapping(gamepad.id, XRMappingConstants.MappingType.WebVR);\n    let xrGamepad = new XRGamepad(gamepad, mapping, gamepad.handedness);\n    xrGamepads[gamepad] = xrGamepad;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction onGamepadDisconnected(event) {\n  if (xrGamepads[event.gamepad]) {\n      delete xrGamepads[event.gamepad];\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Engine Loop\nOn each frame, the gamepad data must be requeried and the engine must respond accordingly to the new data.  This will be the same for both WebXR and WebVR\n\n```js\nfunction updateGamepads() {\n  Object.key(xrGamepads).forEach((key) => {\n    let xrGamepad = xrGamepads[key];\n    xrGamepads.components.forEach((xrComponent) => {\n      const xrComponentData = xrComponent.getData();\n      MyEngine.respondToInput(key, xrComponentData);\n\n      const weightedVisualizations = xrComponent.getWeightedVisualizations();\n      MyEngine.updateInputVisuals(key, weightedVisualizations);\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n> TODO Add an explanation for how to updated the visuals based on the weighted visualizations\n\n## Target Ray Origin\nIn WebXR and WebVR a target ray may be drawn for motion controllers, however the origin of this ray is retrieved differently for each.\n\n### WebXR Target Ray Origin\nIn WebXR, the `XRInputSource.targetRaySpace` should be passed into `XRFrame.getPose()` to determined the pointing origin.\n\n```js\nfunction getTargetRayOrigin(xrFrame, xrInputSource) {\n  return xrFrame.getPose(xrInputSource.targetRaySpace, xrReferenceSpace);\n}\n```\n\n### WebVR Target Ray Origin\nIn WebVR there is no implicit mechanism for retrieving a target ray origin.  Instead, it must be retrieved from the the mapping via the `XRGamepad` and multiplied by the `Gamepad` object's pose in matrix form.\n```js\nfunction getTargetRayOrigin(xrGamepad){\n  let targetRayOrigin;\n\n  const gamepadPose = xrGamepad.gamepad.gamepadPose;\n  if (gamepadPose && gamepadPose.hasOrientation && gamepadPose.hasPosition) {\n    const gamepadPoseMatrix = new MyMatrixMathLibrary.RigidTransform(gamepadPose.position, gamepadPose.orientation);\n    targetRayOrigin = MyMatrixMathLibrary.Multiply(gamepadPoseMatrix, xrGamepad.targetRayOrigin);\n  }\n\n  return targetRayOrigin;\n}\n```\n\n# Appendices\n\n## Licence\nPer the [LICENSE.md](LICENCE.md) file, this repository is made available under an MIT license and is copyright Amazon 2019.\n\n## Hardware\n\n### Supported\n* [Gear VR](mappings/GearVR)\n* [HTC Vive Controller](mappings/HTCViveController)\n* [Oculus Go](mappings/OculusGo)\n* [Oculus Touch](mappings/OculusTouch)\n* [Windows Mixed Reality](mappings/045E-065D)\n\n### Missing Mapping and/or Assets\n* Google Daydream\n* Google Mirage Solo\n* HTC Vive Focus\n* Magic Leap One\n* Oculus Quest\n* Valve Knuckles\n* Windows Mixed Reality for Samsung Odyssey\n\n## References\n* [GitHub - stewdio/THREE.VRController: Support hand controllers for Oculus, Vive, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, GearVR, and more by adding VRController to your existing Three.js-based WebVR project.](https://github.com/stewdio/THREE.VRController)\n* [assets/controllers at gh-pages · aframevr/assets · GitHub](https://github.com/aframevr/assets/tree/gh-pages/controllers)\n* [Unity - Manual:  Input for OpenVR controllers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OpenVRControllers.html)\n* [Steam VR Template -        Unreal Engine Forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/vr-ar-development/78620-steam-vr-template?106609-Steam-VR-Template=)\n* [Mapping Oculus Controller Input to Blueprint Events](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-controller-input-mapping-reference/)"

            "text": "# Computer vision for XR\n\n\nThis is a feature repo (as defined in the proposals process) that has been created for exploring computer vision APIs for XR.\n\nThe conversation that led to the creation of this repo can be found in [Proposals Issues #4](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues/4).\n\nBlair MacIntyre (@blairmacintyre) is coordinating the creation of the initial explainers.\n\n# Top Level Documents in this Repository\n\nThe topic of _computer vision support_ is broad, and implementing support on the web, even just within the context of devices supported by the WebXR Device API, could be approached in a number of different ways.  In this repository, we would like to capture and document the various ways this could be thought about, even though the initial proposal will focus on a subset of the possible approaches and use cases.\n\nThere are 5 potential use cases we could consider working on, intertwined but sufficiently separate we can talk about them separately. These will be documents in separate explainers.\n\n\n- Synchronous access to video frames from the camera in GPU memory, particularly on video-mixed-reality devices (e.g., phones running ARKit/ARCore). The scenario here is to support applications creating visual effects by having access to the video in GPU memory, so the simple \"overlay graphics on video\" approach can be augmented with shadows, reflection, distortion and other effects. It should be possible to implement more efficiently than would be possible if the video frames were first loaded into Javascript buffers, and there is the possibility to address privacy concerns if the implementation can arrange for GPU memory to not to be accessible in Javascript. Documented in [video-effects.md](video-effects.md)\n\n - Asynchronous access to video frames in the CPU and/or GPU. Asynchronous because most non-video-mixed devices do not run the camera and display at the same frame rates, so synchronized access may not be practical. The scenario here is to do real-time computer vision (e.g., SLAM like 6d.ai, 8thWall, etc. are working on; CV tracking algorithms like Vuforia; face and object detection) in a platform independent way. Some of what will be done here might eventually make it into platforms (and may already exist in some platforms), such as image detection. Others would include custom algorithms that need to work everywhere, to support web applications for art, advertising, games, and so on. Documented in [cv-in-page.md](cv-in-page.md)\n\n - Extending WebRTC to support access to cameras on XR device sessions, and streaming/recording of video from XR devices. One goal of this approach is to avoid duplicating functionality across Web APIs (e.g., keep video device access in one place).  The core scenario here is \"a worker wants to allow an expert to see what they are seeing, and overlay augmentations in their view.\" This scenario applies to enterprise scenarios as well as consumer apps. For consumers, this is \"home owner wants to show Home Depot consultant something, get guidance and order parts for repair\". This work will likely need to be done over in the WebRTC WG, as they work on the next version of WebRTC, but we should track it here in a document with relevant pointers to issues and capabilities. Documented in [webrtc-remote-video.md](webrtc-remote-video.md)\n\n- Exposing native, cross platform CV algorithms. The browser can expose entire algorithms running on the camera video, as suggested by the [shape-detection api proposal](https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/).  We could start with very basic capabilities (like detecting barcodes in 3D, images, perhaps faces). Some of the specific algorithms could be optional, but it would be nice if there were very straightforward things (like barcodes, discussed in the shape-detection api) that could be implemented everywhere. If video frames are available inside the web page, it may be possible to polyfill them with WASM implementations.  Developers and users would benefit strongly from having some common capabilities that are implemented natively when possible (e.g., using ARKit for image detection on iOS), and having an agreed upon approach for exposing platform-specific capabilities that might be hard to implement in WASM (like ARKit/ARCore's more advanced features). Documented in [cv-in-browser.md](cv-in-browser.md)\n\n- Exposing native computer vision building blocks and/or components, in a way that leverages native processing of video frames before sending the pre-processed video frames (and associated data) into the web app (either into the GPU or CPU), perhaps leveraging a library like [Khronos' OpenVX](https://www.khronos.org/openvx/). (In fact, one way this could be thought about is by working with Khronos to define WebVX.) Being able to leverage optimized platform capabilities for doing well-known basic algorithms (image pyramids, simple feature extraction, image conversion, blur, etc) could speed up in-app CV, and also allow some of the effects that might be done in the synchronous GPU case to be done faster. Like the WebRTC discussion, if we wanted to pursue this, we would want to do that elsewhere, but the scenario has been brought up multiple times, so we should document, summarize and record it it here. Documented in [webvx.md](webvx.md).\n\nThe first two are the focus of this repository, and share a common need to have the available cameras exposed and the developer request access to them. They can likely be done in the same API (e.g., request cameras, direct data to CPU and/or GPU, guarantee that if the camera is synch with rAF that the data will be available before rAF and make this known if so), but are separable if we only want to tackle one first.

            "text": "### Layers in WebXR\n\nCurrent WebXR spec is written with layers in mind (see [XRLayer interface](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xrlayer-interface)), however, only a single layer ([baseLayer](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#dom-xrrenderstate-baselayer)) is currently supported.\n\nOther XR APIs (such as soon-to-be-public-supposedly-open-api-for-XR, Oculus SDK, more? tbd) support so called “VR compositor layers”.\n\n### Summary\n\nObjects and textures rendered as compositor layers render at the frame rate of the compositor, the refresh rate of the HMD, instead of rendering at the application frame rate. Because of this, the compositor layers are less prone to judder and are raytraced through the lenses, as well as textures / videos are not double sampled and sampled directly by the compositor at full resolution. This improves the clarity of the textures or text displayed on them.\n\n### Example use cases\n\nCompositor layers are useful for displaying information, text, video, or textures that are intended to be focal objects in your scene. Compositor layers can also be useful for displaying simple environments and backgrounds to your scene.\n\nOne of the very common use cases of WebXR is 180 and/or 360 photos or videos, both - equirect and cubemaps. Usual implementation involves a lot of CPU and GPU power and the result is usually pretty poor in terms of visual quality, latency and power consumption (the latter is especially critical for mobile / standalone devices, such as Oculus Go, Quest, Vive Focus, ML1, HoloLens, etc).\n\nAnother example where compositor layers are going to shine is displaying text or high resolution textures in the virtual world. Since compositor layers allow to sample source texture at full resolution without downsampling to the resolution of the eye buffers (which is usually much lower than the physical resolution of the device's screen(s)) the readability of the text is going to be significantly improved.\nI would propose two types of compositor layers for the text - quad and cylinder. While cylinder layer is harder to implement than a simple Quad, it provides much better way to display readable text in VR space. But if the cylinder layer is not supported by the certain hardware or the browser then the Quad layer could be used.\n\n### Implementation overview\n\nA very high-level description of the implementation could be this:\n* Replace the XRRenderState [baseLayer](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#dom-xrrenderstate-baselayer) with the sequence of XRLayers;\n* Introduce different subtypes to [XRLayer](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xrlayer-interface) which will have all the necessary attributes for each layer;\n* Introduce a way to determine which layers are supported and what is the maximum amount of the layers supported;\n\n### Proposed types of layers\nNot all layers are going to be supported by all hardware/browsers. We would need to figure out the bare minimum of layer types to be supported. I have the following ones in mind: the transparent or opaque quadrilateral, cubemap, cylindrical and equirect\n layers.\n \n *to be continued...*\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "<p>We invite you to visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/\">the main site for this Community Group</a> (&lt;https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/&gt;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many technical issues in presenting mathematics in today's Open Web Platform, which has led to the poor access to Mathematics in Web Pages. This is in spite of the existing de jure or de facto standards for authoring mathematics, like MathML, LaTeX, or asciimath, which have been around for a very long time and are widely used by the mathematical and technical communities. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While MathML was supposed to solve the problem of rendering mathematics on the web it lacks in both implementations and general interest from browser vendors. However, in the past decade, many math rendering tools have been pushing math on the web forward using HTML/CSS and SVG. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the identified issues is that, while browser manufacturers have continually improved and extended their HTML and CSS layout engines, the approaches to render mathematics have not been able to align with these improvements. In fact, the current approaches to math layout could be considered to be largely disjoint from the other technologies of OWP. Another key issue, is that exposing (and thus leveraging) semantic information of mathematical and scientific content on the web needs to move towards modern practices and standards instead of being limited to a single solution (MathML). Such information is critical for accessibility, machine-readability, and re-use of mathematical content. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Community Group intends to look at the problems of math on the web in a very bottom-up manner. Experts in this group should identify how the core OWP layout engines, centered around HTML, SVG, and CSS, can be re-used for the purpose of mathematical layout by mapping mathematical entities on top of these, thereby ensuring a much more efficient result, and making use of current and future OWP optimization possibilities. Similarly, experts should work to identify best practices for semantics from the point of view of today's successful solutions. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work should also reveal where the shortcomings are, from the mathematical layout point of view, in the details of these OWP technologies, and propose improvements and possible additions to these, with the ultimate goal of reaching out to the responsible W3C Working Groups to make these changes. This work may also reveal new technology areas that should be specified and standardized on their own right, for example in the area of Web Accessibility. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate goal is to pave the way for a standard, highly optimized implementation architecture, on top of which mathematical syntaxes, like LaTeX or MathML, may be mapped to provide an efficient display of mathematical formulae. Note that, although this community group will concentrate on mathematics, many other areas, e.g., science and engineering, will benefit from (and factor into) the approach and from the core architecture.</p>\r\n",

      "description": "Existing W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input. \r\n\r\nMany of these new applications take the form of \"virtual assistants\". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or  ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion.\r\nSpeech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.",

See also the related [Minimum PDDI Information Ontology](https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO/) project.\n\n- Decision-trees - documents that hold the exemplar potential drug-drug interactions PDDI used to build and validate the minimum information model. There is a single document for each PDDI. Each document provides a description of the PDDI, a decision trees for the clinical context, and references \n\n- Med-Rec-Use-Case - documents describing the medication reconciliation use case used to validate the minimum informaton model\n\n- Stakeholder-descriptions - documents that define the intended users of the minimum information model and provide specific user stories for each intended user\n\n- Presentations - presentations related to the minimum information model\n\n- src - Source code used to demonstrate the minimum information model\n\n## Overview:\n\nObjectives: Develop a minimal information model for drug interaction\nevidence and knowledge as part of an Health Information Technology\nstandard like HL7. These include the following activities:\n\n- Clarify definitions for the minimum information items recommended by the relevant stakeholders. See also the related [Minimum PDDI Information Ontology](https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO/) project.\n\n- Propose additional attributes that further specify information relevant for each of the seven information items (e.g., \"what is the basic information that should be provided when discussing clinical consequences, frequency of harm and exposures, etc.)\n\n- Create deliverables using an interesting and non-trivial set of potential drug-drug interactions:\n\n   -- Data Model: A data model (schema) for potential drug interaction knowledge and evidence\n\n   -- Vocabulary: A precise vocabulary describing/defining the data model\n\n   -- Serializations: one or more serialization formats of the abstract\n   data model, such as XML, JSON/JSON-LD, Structured Product Labeling (HL7 CDA),\n   \n\n- Demonstration of how the minimum information model can support medication reconciliation \n\n- Create a foundation for further collaborative work by disseminating results through an interest group note, a website, and an online discussion forum\n\n## Possible workflow and application models for the PDDI minimal information model:\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/W3C-HCLS/w3c-ddi/raw/master/Presentations/images/info-model-value-proposition.png \"Possible workflow and application models for the PDDI minimal information model.\")\n\n## Contributors\n- [rkboyce](https://github.com/rkboyce)\n- [ericprud](https://github.com/ericprud)\n"

Please follow the following guidelines for the contribution workflow:\n- Fork the repository, then clone the fork.\n- Create a local branch in your fork, push commits there, then make a pull request. After the pull request is merged, the local branch can be optionally deleted.\n- Sign the commits (use e.g. `git commit -s -m \"message\"`).\n- Make commit messages specific and informative, e.g. by including issue numbers.\n- For bigger commits, the first line of the commit message should be a short summary, then after an empty line a more detailed description or rationale of the commit should follow.\n- Similarly, pull request comments should follow the same principles as commit messages.\n- For HTML files please provide a link to a rendered diff in the pull request, using the [W3C HTML diff tool](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff) for comparing two versions of the same file from different forks and branches. See an example [here](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff?doc1=https%3A%2F%2Fw3c.github.io%2Fwot-scripting-api%2F&doc2=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdanielpeintner%2Fwot-scripting-api%2Fmaster%2Findex.html).\nNote that the tool expects the \"raw\" link to the files, for instance this file's raw link is [https://github.com/w3c/wotwg/raw/master/README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wotwg/raw/master/README.md) that resolves to [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wotwg/master/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wotwg/master/README.md), and can be obtained by clicking on the `Raw` button when the file is displayed on the github web page.)\n- Pull requests should be reviewed and approved by someone else (typically an editor), then approved and merged by an editor or chair.\n- The preferred way to merge a pull request is by creating a merge commit, or by squashing (select the option from the pull-down menu right to the merge button). To keep full history, rebase merge is fine if commits are well defined and formatted.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## History\n\nSee the [WoT IG repository](https://github.com/w3c/wot).\n\n[WPT]: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/\n[db]: https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/wiki/ (TBD)\n"

            "text": "# Specification 'Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description'\n\nEach commit here will sync it to the master, which will expose the content to http://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/.\n\nTo make contributions, please provide pull-requests to the appropriate files,\nkeeping in mind that some files, most notably `index.html` and `testing/report.html', \nas well as most files under `visualization`, are\nautogenerated and should not be modified directly.\nSee [github help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for \ninformation on how to create a pull request.\n\n## Rendering\n\nPart of the document is automatically rendered using the [STTL.js](https://github.com/vcharpenay/STTL.js/) RDF template engine and Node.js.\n_Any change to the document must be performed on the main HTML template [`index.template.html`](index.template.html)_, and not on `index.html`.\nTo render `index.html`, along with SVG figures, run: \n\n```sh\nnpm run render\n```\n\nYou can also invoke the rendering script directly:\n```sh\n./render.sh\n```\n\nRequirements: Java 8, Node.js 6, [GraphViz](graphviz.org/).\n\nThe script will first download and install some dependencies (triple store, Node.js dependencies) and then execute the JS script `render.js`.\nThe latter should always be execute within `render.sh` since it requires some env variables to be set first.\n\nFor Windows users, the script should be run in a [Cygwin shell](http://cygwin.com/). Git package from Cygwin distribution had better not be used. Alternative Git client distribution such as [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) works better when you encounter an issue building the document using Cygwin.\n\nRendering is primarly based on the content of [`validation/td-validation.ttl`](validation/td-validation.ttl).\nAny customization of the rendering should go there. e.g. by defining `sh:order` or `sh:description` triples for the relevant shapes.\n\n## Implementation Report\n\nTo generate the implementation report,\nincluding a list of normative assertions,\nissue the following command:\n```sh\nnpm run assertions\n```\nA draft implementation report will be generated and output to\n[testing/report.html](testing/report.html)\nwhich will use relative links back up to [index.html](index.html).\nThe input to this process is [index.html](index.html)\n(_not_ `index.html.template`) so make sure to execute `npm run render` first.\n\nFor this to work, the assertions need to \nbe marked up as in the following examples and follow RFC2119 conventions:\n```html\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies\">\n  A JSON TD MAY contain additional optional vocabularies that are \n  not in the Thing Description core model.\n</span>\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies-prefix\">\n  Terms from additional optional vocabularies used in a JSON-TD MUST \n  carry a prefix for identification within the key name\n  (e.g., <tt>\"http:header\"</tt>).\n</span>\n```\n\nThe assertions must be marked up as follows:\n* Enclose each assertion in a span.\n* Mark the span with unique id.\n  It is recommended that the section id be followed\n  by a short unique name for the specific assertion.\n* Mark the span with a 'class' attribute set to `rfc2119-assertion`.\n* Include one (and only one) instance of the RFC2119 keywords (MUST, MAY, etc.)\n  in capitals.\nThis markup does not change the rendering; it just clearly indicates\nand uniquely names the assertion.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to make assertions independent of context.\nIn particular, avoid using pronouns or relational expressions\nreferring to previous statements not included in the assertion.\nSuch references can always be replaced with their\nantecendent (\"dereferenced\") without changing the meaning,\nand this is less ambigious anyway.\nFor example, instead of using \"this serialization\", use\n\"a JSON-TD serialization\".\n\nAlso, assertions should ideally only constrain one item.\nMultiple constraints should be stated in separate sentences.\n\nNote that the above rendering process also assigns each\ntable entry a unique ID and these are also listed in the \ntable included in the implementation report.\n\nOther data, e.g. data from test results, test specifications,\nand implementation descriptions, are also needed to complete the \nimplementation report.  See [testing/README.md](testing/README.md)\nfor details.\n\nThe generation of the implementation report also generates a CSS file\n`testing/atrisk.css`\nthat highlights at-risk items in the generated `index.html`.  The at-risk\nitems are listed in `testing/inputs/atrisk.csv`.  If at-risk items are\nupdated, to update the at-risk highlighting the implementation report\nneeds to be generated first, and then the rendering.\n"

The [index.html](./index.html) file contains the latest Editors Draft. See the rendered version here: [http://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/](http://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/).\n\nCopies of the releases for [published versions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/) are found in [releases](./releases/).\nThe latest published version currently is the [First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wot-scripting-api-20170914/).\n\nSee the [rationale.md](./rationale.md) for explanation on API design choices.\n\nSee the [primer.md](./primer/README.md) for explaining and illustrating the usage of the API.\n\nSee the [applications/script-manager](./applications/script-manager/README.md) on the design of a Thing for script management.\n\nSee the [applications/thing-directory](./applications/thing-directory/README.md) on the design of a Thing directory (reverse proxy) that would cache nearby Things, provide a single point of access and synchronize with the cached Things.\n\nTo make contributions, please refer to [https://github.com/w3c/wotwg#contributing](https://github.com/w3c/wotwg#contributing).\n\n## TypeScript Definitions\n\nThe specification uses WebIDL definitions. TypeScript definititions are also available (see https://github.com/thingweb/wot-typescript-definitions/blob/master/index.d.ts).\n\nDue to different implementation progress the definitions might be out of sync. However, there are regular sync points usually based on publication releases.\nNote: For future releases we plan to use TypeScript instead of WebIDL in the specification.\n"

Open Athletics includes schemes and vocabularies to describe sports, as well as open source software that helps managing that kind of information.\n\nThrough OpenTrack and Open Athletics, entities around the world (sport clubs, federations, private event organizers, etc.) will be able to open the data contributing towards open data in sports. This will bring new business opportunities to third parties (developers, public bodies, private companies, citizens, academia).\n\nIn order to maximize the impact and adoption of the final proposal, this initiative is supported by [European Athletics](http://www.european-athletics.org) and other [relevant institutions](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/participants) of the world of *Data Management* and *Athletics*.\n\nRead the [Charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html) for more information about this group.\n\n## What tools?\n\nThe main component of OpenTrack is a set of vocabularies and taxonomies that will help publishers to model and expose information regarding athletics (events, athletes, facilities, results, rankings, and others).\n\nParticipants in this group will contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.\n\nCurrently, we are working on what we call it, **Open Athletics** models, vocabularies, and tools: \n\n* A **[Conceptual Data Model for Athletics](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/model/)** to define Athletics competitions, events, management and participation in an abstract way; and\n* a **[Sports Competition Data Model and Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/competition/)** based on Schema.org. It contains examples of implementation for competitions, participation, athletes, organizations, etc.\n* some **[code examples](http://purl.org/athletics/codes)** to illustrate how to use the former vocabulary to describe entities (i.e., athletes, clubs, and federations), and competitions (i.e., disciplines, categories, events) and some useful codes and taxonomies for countries, in-competition features, etc.\n\n## Formats and standards\n\nAll documents will be written in English and encoded in UTF-8.\n\nSchemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.\n\n\n## Can I use it?\n\nOf course you can! Unless the piece of software or document listed in this repository has specified an explicit license, everything is under the [W3C Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document). This means that, by default, you have permission to copy, modify, and distribute OpenTrack works, with or without modification, for any purpose and without fee or royalty.\n\n## How can I participate?\n\nEveryone —either W3C Member or not— is invited to [join the W3C OpenTrack CG](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/). Just click on the 'join' button, and register with your W3C account (in case you don't have, please [request one](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request). Once you are a group member, you will be subscribed to the [main mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-opentrack/).\n\nIf you have never used Github, please have a look at [this guide on how to use Github at W3C](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/Github).\n\n## References\n\nThis work is based on previous works on sports data modeling, such as:\n\n* IOC [ODF](http://odf.olympictech.org/2016-Rio/rio_2016_OG.htm)\n* IPTC [SportsML](https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/). Vocabularies for sharing content (e.g., news) about sports in general. There are some specific vocabularies for concrete sports.

EPUB 3 publications are checked against the EPUB 3.0.1 family of specifications.\n\n[EPUBCheck 4.2.0-rc](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases/tag/v4.2.0-rc) is the release candidate of the forthcoming 4.2.0 version, to be used for testing and preparing the update in production workflows. It features complete support for the EPUB 3.2 family of specifications.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation on how to **use** EPUBCheck, to **contribute** to the project or to **translate** messages is available on the [EPUBCheck wiki](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/wiki).\n\nTechnical discussions are held on our public [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-epubcheck/). To subscribe to the mailing list, send an email with subject `subscribe` to [public-epubcheck-request@w3.org](mailto:public-epubcheck-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe). To participate in the discussion, simply send an email to [public-epubcheck@w3.org](mailto:public-epubcheck-request@w3.org).\n\nHistorical archives of discussions prior to October 2017 are stored at the old [EPUBCheck Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/epubcheck).\n\n## Building EPUBCheck\n\nTo build epubcheck from the sources you need Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7 or above and [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 or above installed.\n\nYou will also need Python to be able to run the BookReporter and related tools.\n\nBuild and run tests:\n\n```\n$ mvn install\n```\nWill copy `.*jar` files and packages to `target/` folder...\n\n## Credits\n\nMost of the EPUBCheck functionality comes from the schema validation tool [Jing](http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html) and schemas that were developed by [IDPF](http://www.idpf.org/) and [DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/). Initial EPUBCheck development was largely done at [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com/).\n\nInitial (pre 2012) authors and contributors to EPUBCheck include: Peter Sorotokin, Garth Conboy, Markus Gylling, Piotr Kula, Paul Norton, Jessica Hekman, Liza Daly, George Bina, Bogdan Iordache, Ionut-Maxim Margelatu\n\nEPUBCheck 4.0 was largely developed by\n* [DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/), namely: Romain Deltour, Markus Gylling\n* [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com), namely: Steve Antoch, Arwen Pond\n\nRegular contributors between 2012 and 2017 include: Romain Deltour, Tobias Fischer, Markus Gylling, Satoshi KOJIMA, Thomas Ledoux, Masayoshi Takahashi\n\nMany thanks are also extended to the numerous people who have contributed to the evolution of EPUBCheck through bug reports and patches!\n\n## Donators\n\nThe following organizations are supporting the development of EPUBCheck by their contribution to the [fundraising initiative](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck_fundraising):\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.macmillanlearning.com\"><img alt=\"MacMillan Learning\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/MacLearn_logo_cmyk.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com\"><img alt=\"Google\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Google.png\" width=\"400\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"http://daisy.org\"><img alt=\"DAISY\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/daisy_high.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://pubhub.dk\"><img alt=\"Publizon A/S\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/publizon-logo.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com\"><img alt=\"Wiley\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Wiley_Wordmark_black.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com\"><img alt=\"Hachette Livre\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Hachette%20Livre.jpg\" width=\"300\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.learningmate.com\"><img alt=\"LearningMate Solutions Inc\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/LearningMate%20Logo.png\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.voyager.co.jp\"><img alt=\"Voyager Japan, Inc.\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/rectangle_VJstar_logo_512.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://qainfotech.com\"><img alt=\"QA Info Tech\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/QA%20InfoTech%20Logo%20PNG%20Format.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com\"><img alt=\"W.

Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## Tools\n\nGenerating weekly minutes is done via the\n[scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional\nconfiguration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).\n\nTo use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen run the following (with date\ninformation changed to match your scenario):\n\n```bash\n$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\n\nThis will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into\nthe Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this\nrepositories other documents.\n\nIf you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to\nincorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such\nas `https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can\nreference that input document directly (rather than using the automagic\ndate-based retrieval).\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt > 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt\n$ npm run scribejs -- 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\nEdit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once\nfinished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it\nfor your records).\n"

            "text": "## What’s going on here?\n\nService workers are a new browser feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages. Unlike other workers, service workers can be shut down at the end of events, note the lack of retained references from documents, and they have access to domain-wide events such as network fetches.\n\nService workers also have scriptable caches. Along with the ability to respond to network requests from certain web pages via script, this provides a way for applications to “go offline”.\n\nService workers are meant to replace the ([oft maligned](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag)) [HTML5 Application Cache](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#offline). Unlike AppCache, service workers are comprised of scriptable primitives with an extensive use of [Promises](//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that make it possible for application developers to build URL-friendly, always-available applications in a sane and layered way.\n\nTo understand the design and how you might build apps with service workers, see the [explainer document](explainer.md).\n\n## Spec and API development\n\nFor the nitty-gritty of the API, the draft W3C specifications are authoritative. [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a living document. [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a subset of the nightly version that is advancing toward a W3C Recommendation. For implementers and developers who seek all the latest features, [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a right document that is constantly reflecting new requirements. For version 1, contributors plan to focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues without including new features from the nightly version.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change `docs/index.bs` and submit it with the corresponding bikesheded `index.html`.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe W3C Web Mobile Group have defined a [series of use-cases where service worker is particularly useful](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/ServiceWorkersDemos). You can help by adding more use cases, draft implementation code, or even working examples once browsers support the required APIs.\n\n\n## About labels and milestones on issues\nThis is to explain how we use labels and milestones to triage the issues. Note: This is a draft, suggestions for improvements are welcomed.\n\n\n### Prioritization\n- **enhancement**: is for anything that was assessed as not having any impact on the decisions for the current milestone and can therefore be safely discussed, rejected or prioritized later.\n- **milestone**: is used to mark issues we agreed to get done in principle by a given revision. For the sake of efficiency, we tend to only focus on the current milestone and leave everything else without specific milestones.\n- **impacts MVP**: is used to mark issues impacting the “Minimal Viable Product”. The MVP is the minimal scope of API that can solve actual use cases. These issues have the highest priority.\n\n*Risk labels for impacts MVP issues*\n\n- **medium risk**: to further refine the “impacts MVP” issues. It indicates that the issue is moderately complex and that reaching a conclusion might take some time. These are of higher priority than issues with no risk label but are of lower priority than issues with a “high risk” label.\n- **high risk**: to further refine the “impacts MVP” issues. It indicates that the issue is significantly complex and that reaching a conclusion might take a lot of time and effort. These are of higher priority than issues with no risk label or a “medium risk” label.\n\n\n\n### Actions\n- **needs spec**: a decision has been made and the spec needs to be updated.\n- **spec detail**: has no significant implications for implementers nor web developers.\n- **decided**: to record that a decision has been made.\n- **invalid**: when something doesn’t constitute a valid issue.\n- **wontfix**: a decision has been made not to pursue this issue further.\n- **duplicate**: when a similar issue has already been filed.\n- **bug**: an oversight that needs to be fixed.\n\n\n### Areas\n- **fetch**: relates to Fetch\n- **lifecycle**: relates to lifecycle aspects of service worker\n- **cache**: relevant to the Cache APIs\n- **question**: not an actual issue. Items that have been filed in order to gain a better understanding of service worker.\n"

We want users to be able to tell when content is reliable, accurate, and shared in good faith, and to help them steer away from deceptive content. At the same time, we affirm the need for users to find the content they want and to interact freely in the communities they choose. To balance any conflict between these goals, we are committed to providing technologies which keep end-users in control of their Web experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group's primary strategy involves data sharing on the Web, in the style of schema.org, using existing W3C data standards like JSON-LD.  We believe significant progress toward our goals can be reached by properly specifying \"credibility indicators\", a vocabulary/schema for data about content and the surrounding ecosystem, which can help a person and/or machine decide whether a content item should be trusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please see the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"wiki/\">group wiki</a> for more details.</p>",

This is area-2 of the [credible web work](https://credweb.org).\n\nSee: https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1969 for work on ClaimReview itself.\n\nThe suggested proposals in this area are:\n\n1. Allow professional fact-checks to be published in machine readable form so they can more easily be matched, used in automated assessments, and shown to users when appropriate. (Already being done using claimreview)\n2. Allow claim-extraction processes to publish their output for broad consumption. This would be a feed of claims found in the media and judged to be of relatively high value for checking. \n3. Allow users to express their desire for specific claims in some content to be checked. Might include offer to pay for results.\n4. Allow relationships between claims to be expressed, such as rephrasings to be more precise and context-free vs more terse and context-sensitive, more in agreement vs disagreement with the claim itself, making a broader vs narrower claim, between natural languages, and opposites.\n5. Allow structure of a fact-check to be exposed as machine-readable, showing argumentation and secure links to the evidence\n6. Allow end-users to express what they feel or know relevant to a claim’s accuracy, in a way that might be reasonable aggregated toward accurate credibility assessment. It's important this not be simply popularity polling; important ideas, when they start, are usually believed by exactly one person.\n7. Make it easy to view reviews of related claims from many sources at once, including some data about the sources, such as assessed bias\n\nSome relevant technologies:\n\n* Claim extraction: given some natural language text, recognize fragments that are likely to be checkable claims\n* Claim matching: given some claim text, find other claims which are likely to be highly relevant\n* Claim interpretation: given some natural language claim text, automatically perform relevant databases searches and calculations to check it\n\n"

There is a separate [list of repos of this WG](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ajson-ld-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories).\n\nAll repositories for spec development share the same set of labels; inspired by the [labels organized for W3C specification](https://w3c.github.io/issue-metadata.html).\n\n## Contributing to the JSON-LD Working Group Repositories\n\nUse the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## Tools\n\nGenerating weekly minutes is done via the\n[scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional\nconfiguration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).\n\nTo use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen run the following (with date\ninformation changed to match your scenario):\n\n```bash\n$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2018-07-06 -o _minutes/2018-07-06-json-ld.md\n```\n\nThis will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into\nthe Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this\nrepositories other documents.\n\nIf you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to\nincorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such\nas `https://www.w3.org/2018/07/06-json-ld-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can\nreference that input document directly (rather than using the automagic\ndate-based retrieval).\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://www.w3.org/2018/07/06-json-ld-irc.txt > 2018-07-06-json-ld-irc.txt\n$ npm run scribejs -- 2018-07-06-json-ld-irc.txt -d 2018-07-06 -o _minutes/2018-07-06-json-ld.md\n```\nEdit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once\nfinished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it\nfor your records).\n\n### Jekyll\n\nThis site is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you have Jekyll\nand npm installed, you can run `npm run serve` to have Jekyll watch the\nworking directory for changes and compile the templates (etc) incrementally.\n\nOnce run, you can browse the site at `http://localhost:4000/2018/json-ld-wg/`\n(the extra path information is *required* to match the w3.org hosting location).\n"

            "text": "# Governance and Contribution to the Distributed Tracing working group\n\nThis document describes the contribution and governance rules for the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). This includes the following specifications\n\n- [Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context)\n- [Correlation Context](https://github.com/w3c/correlation-context)\n\n## Interacting with the working group\n\nThe working group encourages all forms of contribution and questions. If you have a question, please open an issue on Github in the specification repository. \n\n## Collaboration under the W3C Process Model\n\nAs the working group is an W3C working group it operates under the [W3C Process Model](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/). All further contribution guidelines only extend the W3C process model. If this document and the process model contradict each other, the W3C process model takes precedence.\n\n\n## Meetings\n\nMeetings follow the [W3C Process Model Guidelines for Meetings](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#GeneralMeetings). This section defines additional meeting guidelines extending these guidelines:\n\n- Official conference calls are held on a bi-weekly basis and are announced on a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dynatrace.com_5a09qhua6fh7jb23h7vdjg6veg%40group.calendar.google.com)\n- Face-to-face topic-based work meetings will be announced at least 4 weeks in advance. Ideally, they are announce 8 weeks in advance as defined in the W3C process model. \n- Proposed changes to any document MUST be handled via a Pull Request (PR). If the change came up during a meeting the meeting owner is responsible for creating the PR.\n- PRs will be reviewed during official meetings, but off-line reviews (LGTMs, NOT LGTMs) and comments are strongly encouraged to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting.\n- If a topic is not defined specifically enough yet to justify a PR against the specification, contributors are encouraged to file an issue. \n- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for a vote over those that appear to require discussions.\n- Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial. Note, administrative PRs that do not materially modify output documents may be processed by admins as needed.\n- PR's can be marked for resolution during a meeting and will be merged when all issues have been addressed and the PR was open for comments for at least one business week. \n- If issues arise after a PR has been merged, the preferred approach is to file a new issue. In rare cases the group can decide to revert a PR.\n\n## Participation  \n\nThere are three categories of project participation:\n\n1. Non Working Group Member. This is anyone who  participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). In contrast to Working Group members they can file a PR but not vote on a PR. They can, however, create issues for specifications. \n2. Working Group Member. This is anyone who officially participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). Working group members can file PRs against documents and can participate in the PR voting procedure. Working Group members need to be employed by a W3C member organization or participate as invited experts. The [W3C process document](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#MemberBenefits) defines the rights of members. \n3. Chairs and Co-Chairs are members of the group but have the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the group. For example, manage the website, github repos and moderate the meetings. Their actions should be done with the knowledge and consent of the group. They also have the ability to merge/close PRs, but only per the group's approval. \n\n## PRs and Voting\n\nSpecificaiton changes are proposed via PRs which are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being merged:\n\n- The author of the PR indicates that it is ready setting a \"ready to review\" tag for review by asking for it to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda document.\n- All comments have been addressed.\n- PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed in dedicated by interested parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.\n\nEvery member of the working group is encouraged to vote with a statement of support and dissent on any PR. If a member has concerns regarding a PR they are encouraged to comment on the issue and join in discussions. If a member does reply to a comment within a reasonable timeframe - one business week - the comment is considered properly addressed. \n\nThe goal of the working group is to reach consensus by discussion. If consensus cannot be reached the [W3C Voting rules](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Votes) apply. \n"

Please make sure to read rationale documents when you have a question about particular\ndecision made in specification.\n\n## Goal\n\nThis specification defines formats to pass trace context information across systems. Our goal is\nto share this with the community so that various tracing and diagnostics products can operate\ntogether.\n\n- If this becomes popular, frameworks and other services will automatically pass\n  trace IDs through for correlated requests. This would prevent traces from\n  hitting dead ends when a request reaches an un-instrumented service.\n- Once aligned on a header name, we can ask for a CORS exception from the W3C.\n  This would allow browsers to attach trace IDs to requests and submit tracing\n  data to a distributed tracing service.\n- Loggers can reliably parse trace / span IDs and include them in logs for\n  correlation purposes.\n- Customers can use multiple tracing solutions (Zipkin + New Relic) at the same\n  time and not have to worry about propagating two sets of context headers.\n- Frameworks can *bless* access to the trace context even if they prevent access\n  to underlying request headers, making it available by default.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n- [Group participants](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=108594&order=org&public=1)\n- [How to join](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/join)\n- [Royalty-Free Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/status)\n"

By \"RDF\" we mean the whole RDF ecosystem -- including SPARQL, OWL, tools, standards, educational materials, etc. -- everything that a developer touches when using RDF.  Our plan:_\n* _focus and coordinate community efforts;_\n* _build on existing standards whenever possible;_\n* _launch additional W3C Community Groups to tackle specific areas of need, including_\n  * _[n3-dev Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/n3-dev/), for standardizing N3 rules; and_\n* _contribute to (and benefit from) related efforts, such as the [W3C Graph Data Workshop](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html) in March 2019, which prepare the path for launching new standards work at W3C._\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe value of RDF for graph data has been well proven, in many applications, over the 20+ years since it was first created.  However, difficulty of use has caused RDF to be categorized as a niche technology. This is unfortunate because it limits uptake and prevents RDF from being viewed as a viable choice for many use cases that would otherwise be an excellent fit.\n\nThis work seeks to build upon our experience with RDF to examine how we can make it easier to use.  What aspects or gaps have caused difficulty?    How can RDF better support features that users commonly need and other graph databases offer?  How can we make RDF -- or a successor -- easy enough for *average* developers?\n\nAt the same time, businesses are now showing a rapidly growing interest in graph data.  Businesses have used relational databases for many years, but it is costly to adapt database schema and applications in response to evolving application needs.  Other graph and NoSQL databases have emerged to help meet this need.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of interoperability across existing graph data solutions, motivating [interest in open standards for an interchange framework](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html).  RDF is an appealing vendor neutral framework for graph data, and is well positioned to take on the role of an interchange framework.  Although this interest in RDF as a graph interchange framework arose independently from the effort to make RDF easier, and has different goals, there is a natural overlap in motivation, and both efforts can benefit each other.\n\n## Guiding principles\n\n**1. The goal is to make RDF -- or some RDF-based successor -- easy enough for *average* developers (middle 33%), who are new to RDF, to be consistently successful.**\n\n**2. Solutions may involve anything in the RDF ecosystem: standards, tools, guidance, etc.  All options are on the table.**\n\n**3. Backward compatibility is highly desirable, but *less* important than ease of use.**\n\n## How to contribute?\n\nWe welcome contributions. A good place to start is to review the [issues list](https://github.com/w3c/EasierRDF/issues), categorized below. Please feel free to start a new issue if none of the existing ones are a good match. We also welcome longer position papers and analyses, preferably in the GitHub markdown format.  You can also send comments to the mailing list: [semantic-web@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/).\n\n## Intellectual property rights\n\nThis work is being performed under the [W3C rdf-dev Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdf-dev/) and is subject to the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).\n\n# Issue topics\n\nIssues and ideas are recorded in our [issues list](https://github.com/w3c/EasierRDF/issues) and divided into the categories below using [issue labels](https://github.com/w3c/EasierRDF/labels).

MathML has had several updates, but is showing its age and needs to be updated. This group will focus on changes to the MathML 3 recommendation so that it better aligns with the current web environment, eases the burden on browser implementations, and increases support for assistive technology.\r\n\r\nThe group will propose a new revision for MathML, potentially with profiles for browsers, publishers, and other subgroups such as authors or online tests. The group will also develop tests so that authors/publishers can be confident that what they see as an author is what the user will see as a reader when the same font is used.\r\n\r\nParticipation is encouraged if you are in involved in publishing, authoring, or rendering math. The group strongly encourages the participation of those involved with browser implementations,  recommendations, and APIs that potentially affect the rendering of math.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "The mission of the Conversational Interfaces Community Group is to enable web developers to collaborate and share conversational experiences for a variety of domains. Most dialogue systems serve interactive experiences in their own domain specific language, causing a fragmented zoo of proprietary formats. For example, Google Home or Alexa do not share a common intermediate representation, which makes writing wide-spread content inaccessible to the mass audience. We study existing specs and design  standards to harness proven techniques into common agreement.
